# *S.* Eastbourne

Salmonella Eastbourne

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Abony (antigenic formula 1,9,12:e,h:1,5) is a serovar of the O:9 (D1) serogroup. Serovar Eastbourne, first identified in England in [1931](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S031554637573804X), was initially isolated in Canada from a human source in 1950 and later from frog legs in 1967. Among reptiles in a zoo education setting, serovar Eastbourne was the predominant serotype ([32%, 22/69](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2012.01521.x#b1)) and has been proposed as a [reptile-associated serotype](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/abstract/1995/11000/reptile_associated_salmonellosis_in_new_york_state.6.aspx).
