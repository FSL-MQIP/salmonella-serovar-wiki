# *S.* Hartford


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Hartford (antigenic formula 6,7:y:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. Serovar Hartford was previously recovered from [non-outbreak cattle herds](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2017.2303?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). Serovar Hartford was found as highly persistent in all [low-aw food ingredient](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X22106150)s.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Hartford has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Hartford isolates. In a [US study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2017.2303), serovar Hartford isolates were found to be pansusceptible to all antimicrobials tested using the Kirby-Bauer method. Additionally, all six Hartford isolates recovered from mesenteric lymph nodes on one of farms were indistinguishable based on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis.

## Animal Reservoir

*Salmonella* Hartford was found in[chicken](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4652083/), [calves, horses, dogs, and wild animals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Hartford%22)) such as [wild black bears](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24320783).
