## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Altona (antigenic formula: 8,20:r,[i]:z<sub>6</sub>) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from fish meal in Germany in [1958](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13558313/).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Altona has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Altona was mainly found in[chickens but was also present in cattle, pigs, and horses](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Altona%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Altona has been reported [worldwide such as the US and the UK.](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Altona%22)>)

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

| Year | Location | Associated source | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | US: multistate | [Backyard poultry](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/salmonella/salmonella-outbreak-backyard-poultry-expands-38-states) | 470<sup>1</sup> |
| 2019 | US: multistate | [Backyard poultry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022028596) | 1,134<sup>2</sup> |
| 2011 | US: multistate | [Chicks and ducklings](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22437914/) | 96<sup>3</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> The outbreak was initially associated with five *Salmonella* serovars: Altona, Indiana, Infantis, Mbandaka, and Typhimurium. The CDC indicated that two more-Cerro and Johannesburg-have been implicated in the illnesses.

<sup>2</sup> Multiple *Salmonella* serovars were found including: Agona, Alachua, Altona, Anatum, Braenderup, Enteritidis, Infantis, Manhattan, Montevideo, Muenchen, Newport, and Oranienburg.

<sup>3</sup>A cluster of 28 cases caused by serovar Johannesburg and a cluster of 68 cases caused by serovar Altona were identified in 24 states.
