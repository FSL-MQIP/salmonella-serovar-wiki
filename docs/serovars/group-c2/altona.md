## Human/Animal Outbreaks

| Year | Location | Associated source | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | US: multistate | [Backyard poultry](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/salmonella/salmonella-outbreak-backyard-poultry-expands-38-states) | 470^1^ |
| 2019 | US: multistate | [Backyard poultry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022028596) | 1,134^2^ |
| 2011 | US: multistate | [Chicks and ducklings](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22437914/) | 96^3^ |

^1^ The outbreak was initially associated with five *Salmonella* serovars: Altona, Indiana, Infantis, Mbandaka, and Typhimurium. The CDC indicated that two more-Cerro and Johannesburg-have been implicated in the illnesses.

^2^ Multiple *Salmonella* serovars were found including: Agona, Alachua, Altona, Anatum, Braenderup, Enteritidis, Infantis, Manhattan, Montevideo, Muenchen, Newport, and Oranienburg.

^3 ^A cluster of 28 cases caused by serovar Johannesburg and a cluster of 68 cases caused by serovar Altona were identified in 24 states.
