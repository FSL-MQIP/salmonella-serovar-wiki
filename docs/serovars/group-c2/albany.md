# *S.* Albany


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Albany (antigenic formula 8,20:z4,z24:-) is a serovar of the O:8 (C2-C3) serogroup.

NCBI PD cannot differentiate between serovar Albany and serovar Duesseldorf; additional genetic markers are required for *in silico* serotyping of serovar Albany. The link is still provided: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Albany%20or%20Duesseldorf%22)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Albany%20or%20Duesseldorf%22))

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Albany has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. [Ali et al.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0034) studied a total of 434 serovar Albany isolates and found a high proportion of Albany isolates demonstrated resistance to nalidixic acid (99.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (97.9%), ampicillin (86.6%), chloramphenicol (86.6%), and tetracycline (85.7%). Additionally, all isolates resistant to cefoxitin carried the CMY-2-type =CE=B2-lactamase and was classified into seven unique pulsotypes, with the majority being types IV-b (43.75%) and IV-a (25%). In a [Taiwanese study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119306182), among turkey isolates they included, 75.3% of Albany isolates (64/85) exhibited resistance to 6 or more antimicrobials. Another [Taiwanese study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.02634-20) stated that Albany strains carrying ICE_erm42 exhibited high-level resistance to azithromycin, and the element was capable of transferring to phylogenetically distant species, such as Vibrio cholerae, through conjugation.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Albany was mainly found in [chicken but was also present in turkey, ducks, pigs, cattle](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0034), and [captive zoo wild animals](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23361445?seq=1).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Albany has been found in the US, Mexico, [Europe](https://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx), and Asian such as South Korea, [Taiwan](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119306182).
