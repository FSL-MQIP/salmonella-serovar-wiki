## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Albany (antigenic formula 8,20:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>24</sub>:-) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Albany has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. [Ali et al.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0034) studied a total of 434 serovar Albany isolates and found a high proportion of Albany isolates demonstrated resistance to nalidixic acid (99.3%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (97.9%), ampicillin (86.6%), chloramphenicol (86.6%), and tetracycline (85.7%). Additionally, all isolates resistant to cefoxitin carried the CMY-2-type β-lactamase and was classified into seven unique pulsotypes, with the majority being types IV-b (43.75%) and IV-a (25%). In a [Taiwanese study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119306182), among turkey isolates they included, 75.3% of Albany isolates (64/85) exhibited resistance to 6 or more antimicrobials. Another [Taiwanese study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.02634-20) stated that Albany strains carrying ICE_erm42 exhibited high-level resistance to azithromycin, and the element was capable of transferring to phylogenetically distant species, such as Vibrio cholerae, through conjugation.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Albany was mainly found in [chicken but was also present in turkey, ducks, pigs, cattle](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0034), and [captive zoo wild animals](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23361445?seq=1).
