## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica *subsp. *enterica *serovar Manhattan (antigenic formula 6,8:d:1,5) is a serovar of the O:6,8 (C<sub>2</sub>) serogroup. [Between 2017 and 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451943X22000199?via%3Dihub), serovar Manhattan represented nearly half (46.7%) of all *Salmonella* isolated from broiler chickens in Japan, a trend that persisted with its detection in chicken breast in [2021](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/foodsafetyfscj/12/3/12_D-24-00002/_article).


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Manhattan has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with two lineages identified and four stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Manhattan isolates. A newly discovered *Salmonella* Manhattan phage, [vB_Sal_M467](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023643825003019#bib34), was isolated and was found to be stable across various temperatures and pH levels with strong lytic activity against 12 different* Salmonella* serotypes, including key proteins like lysozyme, holin, and endopeptidase Rz protein. Additionally, it effectively controlled *Salmonella* Manhattan contamination in milk, apple juice, and lettuce. Two serovar Manhattan isolates with the presence of *qnrS1*, *sul2*, *tet(D)*, *aph(3")-lb/aph(6)-ld*, and *floR* showed resistance to [streptomycin and chloramphenicol](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.912693/full#B33). A [survey from 2009 to 2012](https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-019-1836-6) pointed out that the increasing presence of serovar Manhattan in Japan was associated with a yearly uptick in resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftiofur. A Japanese study found that all serovar Manhattan isolates they tested were susceptible to [β-lactam](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451943X22000199?via%3Dihub) in 2018. Another earlier Japanese study revealed that the majority of serovar Manhattan was susceptible to [kanamycin](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7273603/#:~:text=Manhattan%20serovar%20led%20to%20an,2009%20to%202012%20%5B9%5D.). In addition, those serovar Manhattan isolates exhibited higher resistant rate of β-lactam than serovar Infantis and Schwarzengrund.


## Animal Reservoir

[Pigs](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/genomea.00632-13) and [chickens](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7273603/) are potential reservoirs for serovar Manhattan. Serovar Manhattan was also found in [turtles (chelonians)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.912693/full), and other reptiles including [Iguanas (Conolophus subcristatus)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11731161/), [captive Andros and Bahamian rock iguanas (Cyclura cychlura and Cychlura rileyi)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.72.5.3771-3773.2006).


## Geographical Distribution

According to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Manhattan has been reported [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Manhattan%22)>).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> This outbreak involved multiple serovars including *Salmonella *Agona, Alachua, Altona, Anatum, Braenderup, Enteritidis, Infantis, Manhattan, Montevideo, Muenchen, Newport, and Oranienburg. The number of cases here does not apply only to infections caused by serovar Manhattan.

<sup>2</sup> *Salmonella* Heidelberg and Manhattan were both found.
