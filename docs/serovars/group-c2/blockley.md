## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Blockley (antigenic formula 6,8:k:1,5) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Blockley was first isolated from the stool from a 60-year-old patient in the United States in [1955](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jb.70.3.354-355.1955). This serovar was involved in a case of [cardiac device infection](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4672624/#:~:text=Identification%20of%20the%20isolate%20and,on%20subsequent%20follow%2Dup%20visits.) in China. Interestingly, serovar Blockley was suggested to be associated with [long-term reactive arthritis](https://academic.oup.com/femspd/article/46/1/3/598130). Serovar Blockley was among the five most common isolated serotypes from both avian and human sources in [Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/1/00-0111_article).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Blockley has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified. [Izumiya](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39540775/) et al. found that 264 Blockley isolates can be classified to 10 distinct groups (BAPS A to BAPS J), further categorized into two lineages, R and S. Lineage R was made of six BAPS clusters (BAPSs A-F), primarily found in Africa and Asia, all of which possessed the azithromycin resistance gene mph(A) and other resistance patterns. Lineage R was found to harbor a genomic island with *mph(A*), *aph(3')-Ia*, *aph(3")-Ib*, *aph(6)-Id*, and *tet(A*).

## Animal Reservoir

[Chickens](https://academic.oup.com/femspd/article/46/1/3/598130)are the main reservoir for serovar Blockley. This serovar was also found in [turkey, cattle, and pigs](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Blockley%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Blockley has been reported [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Blockley%22)>) periodically.
