## Background Information

*Salmonella* Goldcoast (antigenic formula: 6,8:​r:l,w) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Goldcoast was isolated for the first time in [Ghana in 1953](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3863217); after the first isolation sporadic cases were identified in Europe. Since [1984-1985](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375974228_Identification_of_IncA_Plasmid_Harboring_blaVIM-1_Gene_in_S_enterica_Goldcoast_ST358_and_C_freundii_ST62_Isolated_in_a_Hospitalized_Patient), serovar Goldcoast started to be more frequently isolated in Europe. [By 2010](http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20424), serovar Goldcoast was reported as the 6<sup>th</sup> most common serovar in [cattle](http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/223r.pdf) in Germany, UK and Spain.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Goldcoast has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A non-Goldcoast serovar, *S*. Benue, clusters within serovar Goldcoast. [ST358 and ST2529](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972307746X) are the predominant lineages of serovar Goldcoast. Multidrug-resistant Goldcoast strains are primarily associated with the ST358 lineage in humans and the ST2529 lineage in livestock. The majority of isolates exhibited resistance to ampicillin (58%), ampicillin/sulbactam (53%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (50%). Additionally, a portion of isolates showed resistance to azithromycin (21%), piperacillin/tazobactam (15%), ceftriaxone (12%), aztreonam (12%), ciprofloxacin (14%), levofloxacin (8%), cefepime (10%), and ceftazidime (8%). However, all strains remained susceptible to imipenem. The ST358 lineage of serovar Goldcoast is estimated to have emerged in the United Kingdom in 1969 and subsequently spread to China. Both countries are considered central hubs for the global dissemination of the ST358 lineage. A [Taiwanese study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213716522000753) revealed that nosocomial outbreak of salmonellosis was caused by extensively drug-resistant (XDR) *Salmonella* Goldcoast strains carrying the bla<sub>OXA-48</sub> gene. These OXA-48–producing XDR strains remain susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam. Based on the analysis of virulence factors in pathogenic Goldcoast strains, [Yuan et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1540843/full) identified that the gene encoded by K19231 in JS33 is associated with the *upaH* gene. This gene regulates the AIDA-I type autotransporter protein, which is a rarely glycosylated protein.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Goldcoast has been isolated from [swine](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/12/eus-notable-2018-food-safety-events/) and [cattle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11273392/).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Goldcoast appears to be [mainly distributed in several European countries](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/6/12/ofz447/5679784) but can be found in countries like[Taiwan](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/6/12/ofz447/5679784).
