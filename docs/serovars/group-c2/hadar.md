## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Hadar (antigenic formula 6,8:z<sub>10</sub>:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. In Europe, this serovar emerged in [1971](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1601188/pdf/brmedj00016-0007.pdf). In [England](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1601188/pdf/brmedj00016-0007.pdf), before 1971, only eight human cases reported; by 1979 a total of 1,600 human salmonellosis cases were confirmed to be caused by serovar Hadar. Serovar Hadar is among the[ top ten serovars from non-clinical non-human sources ](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/pdf/hadar-508c.pdf)in the US. Also, this serovar is the most common serovar isolated from turkey in the US. In Europe, serovar Hadar is the 4<sup>th</sup> most common serovar isolated from humans. Reports of acquisition of serovar Hadar in[ travelers ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14622126)returning from Africa suggest a distribution of this serovar in Africa.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Hadar has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Hadar isolates. As a consequence of the serovar Hadar emergence, a phage typing scheme was developed, this included [24 recognized phage types](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3729881/). The strain isolated from an outbreak associated with[ turkey burgers ](https://web.archive.org/web/20140122214727/https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/hadar0411/040411/index.html)occurred in the U.S. in 2011 showed resistance to several antibiotics commonly used to treat salmonellosis (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalothin, and tetracycline). Among 64 Hadar isolates collected from different patients from 2005 to 2010 in [Switzerland](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9152617/), 71.8% of them showed resistance to nalidixic acid. While 40.6% of the isolates were resistant to the β-lactam antibiotic ampicillin, they remained sensitive to the third-generation cephalosporin cefotaxime. All Hadar strains [Nógrády et al.](https://academic.oup.com/femsle/article/218/1/127/532259) analyzed showed profound growth suppression. Prior colonization of chickens with Hadar strain 18 effectively prevented superinfection by *S*. Enteritidis, Typhimurium, Virchow and Saintpaul. [REPTDK01](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/php/data-research/reptdk01.html) is a REP (reoccurring, emerging, or persisting) strain of *Salmonella *Hadar that has been linked to illnesses and outbreaks in the United States.


## Animal Reservoir

The main reservoirs of serovar Hadar are [turkey flocks and turkey meat](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11384159/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20outbreaks%20of%20foodborne%20Salmonella,to%20the%20backyard%20poultry%20market.). However, [ chickens, ducks and swine ](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Hadar%22)>)are also sources of this serovar.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Hadar has been reported [worldwide such as the US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Hadar%22)>).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

There were multiple human outbreaks of *Salmonella* Hadar. Below are examples.


## Border Rejections

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella *Hadar and Kottbus were both found.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> Plainville Brands, LLC, issued the recall because of the* Salmonella* Hadar outbreak.

<sup>2</sup> Product was (presumably) no longer on the market.
