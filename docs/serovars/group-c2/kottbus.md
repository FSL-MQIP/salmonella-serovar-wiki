## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Kottbus (antigenic formula 6,8:e,h:1,5) is a serovar of the O:8 (C2-C3) serogroup. Across Europe, it is one of the 10 predominant serovars found in turkey. More specifically, according to the [2006–2007 European baseline survey on *Salmonella* in turkey flocks](https://doaj.org/article/a82b59f70be04dccaa1209e4af7a9d32), serovar Kottbus was among the top five serovars in fattening flocks (8.3%) and the second most prevalent in breeding flocks (15.6%).

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Kottbus has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with four lineages identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Kottbus isolates. In Denmark, serovar* *Kottbus carrying [*bla*NDM-1 on a 43 kb IncN2 plasmid](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8326659/) was first isolated in an 82-year-old man with end-stage lung cancer. By analyzing 95 serovar Kottbus isolates obtained in Germany from different sources during the years 2000 to 2011, [Toboldt et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514000558#bib0040) identified three lineages. The majority of human isolates clustered in lineage 1, represented by ST212 and ST808. Lineage 2, characterized by ST582, contained human isolates along with a substantial proportion from poultry and poultry products, and to a lesser degree, other livestock. The third lineage (ST1669) comprised four isolates from both reptilian and human sources. Resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin was predominantly found in lineage 2, which contained a higher proportion of resistant isolates than either lineage 1 or 3.

## Animal Reservoir

 [Poultry including chicken and turkey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514000558)may be potential reservoirs for serovar Kottbus.

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Kottbus has been found reported [worldwide occasionally](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Kottbus%22)).
