## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Litchfield (antigenic formula 6,8:l,v:1,2) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. An outbreak linked to poultry (no further details were included in the paper, so this is not described in the human outbreaks section below), caused by serovar Litchfield, showed the[highest proportion](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10793259/)of positive isolates in urine samples (17%, or 3 out of 18 cases). Serovar Litchfield has also been reported to cause an outbreak in a [herd of cattle](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/20013036586) with sparrows considered as the most likely vehicle of infection.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Litchfield has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with two lineages identified. [Medalla et al.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/fpd.2012.1336) reported that Litchfield (2.9%) has the second highest proportion of isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin in their study. [González-Sanz et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19815633/) reported serovar Litchfield isolated in Spain from 2001 to 2005 with the presence of *bla<sub>CTX-M-1</sub>*. [Yamazaki et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3448258/) reported that a plasmid *pRY82*, which mediates lactose-utilization, was isolated from a serovar Litchfield strain.

## Animal Reservoir

[Poultry](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336241077_Onsite_investigation_at_a_mail-order_hatchery_following_a_multistate_Salmonella_illness_outbreak_linked_to_live_poultry-United_States_2018) and [turtles](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yoken/72/1/72_JJID.2018.140/_article) may be potential hosts.

## Geographical Distribution

Based on the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Litchfield has been reported [worldwide but mainly in US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Litchfield%22)>).
