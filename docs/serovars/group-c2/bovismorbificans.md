## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Bovismorbificans (antigenic formula 6,8,20:r,[i]:1,5) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Bovismorbificans was first reported in grey seals in the UK in [1979](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1979.tb03972.x). The prevalence of this serovar is generally low. For example, between three and fourteen cases of serovar Bovismorbificans occur annually in the [Netherlands](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5765776/).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Bovismorbificans has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that doesn't cluster with any other *Salmonella* Bovismorbificans isolates. [M](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21933168/)[ultidrug-resistant strains](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21933168/) have been isolated from calves in Australia, showing resistance to ampicillin, sulfonamides, tetracycline, neomycin, kanamycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and streptomycin. [Li et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168160521003986?via%3Dihub) isolated two foodborne Bovismorbificans isolates of different origins in China, co-resistant to CIP and CTX, which harbored the same novel IncHI2-ST2 type conjugative plasmid. [Gopinath et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/6/1199) identified two polyphyletic clusters, comprising four STs (2640, 142, 1499, and 377).

## Animal Reservoir

[Pigs](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087933) tend to be the main animal reservoir for serovar Bovismorbificans. This serovar was also found in [cattle, chicken, sheep, and horses](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Bovismorbificans%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Bovismorbificans has been found [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Bovismorbificans%22)>).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

There are multiple outbreaks associated with serovar Bovismorbificans. Here we reported a few as examples.

| Year | Location | Associated source | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022 | Greece | [Tap water](<https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/21/2/167#:~:text=Results:%20We%20identified%2033%20cases%20(median%20age:,tap%20water%20samples%20had%20identical%20PFGE%20profiles.>) | 33 |
| 2020 | France | [Dried pork sausages](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9837855/) | 33 |
| 2018 | Netherlands | [Raw, smoked, and Coburg ham](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5765776/) | 54 |
| 2016 | Europe: multi-country | [Uncooked ham products](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/01/05/Salmonella-Bovismorbificans-outbreak-linked-to-undercooked-ham/?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=09-Jan-2018&c=p%2FtLw%2B6HDRAJ%2F3NhASKrcg%3D%3D&p2=) | 63 (54 Dutch, 7 Belgian, 2 French cases) |
| 2011 | US: multistate | [Tahini](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6146a3.htm) | 9 |

## Border Rejections

Multiple border rejections were found. Here we reported one as example.

| Year | Exporting country | Importing country | Associated source | Product category |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2021 | Brazil | Germany | [Black pepper](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/513983)<sup>1</sup> | Herbs and spices |

<sup>1</sup>Both *Salmonella* Bovismorbificans and *Salmonella* II 42:​r:- were found.

## Recalls

Multiple recalls were reported. Here we selected one as example.

| Year | Location | Recalled product | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020 | France | [Dried pork sausages](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2023/01/french-salmonella-outbreak-study-reveals-dual-contamination/)<sup>1</sup> | Ready-to-eat meat product |

<sup>1</sup> This recall was caused by a Bovismorbificans outbreak infecting 33 people. Three recalls of dried pork products were addressed in November 2020, influencing eight supermarkets.
