## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Corvallis (antigenic formula 8,20:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:[z<sub>6</sub>]) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from the pooled cecal contents of poults affected with enteritis in the United States in [1949](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jb.58.1.111-112.1949). Higher prevalence of serovar Corvallis was observed in humans and food products in [non-European](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21492021/) countries.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Corvallis has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with six lineages identified. By analyzing 388 Corvallis ST1541 isolates collected globally within a twenty-year period, [Chen et al.](https://onehealthadv.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44280-023-00017-9) found that the ST1541 strains carried ColRNA1 plasmids that contain *qnr*-like determinants. Their Bayesian analysis also inferred that the UK might be the origin of *S.* Corvallis strains currently prevailing in multiple regions. [Fischer et al.](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/68/12/2954/696276?redirectedFrom=fulltext) identified NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing strains isolated from a wild bird in Germany.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Corvallis was found to be associated with[ pigs ](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/68/12/2954/696276)in South-East Asia. This serovar was also isolated from [chicken](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Corvallis%22)>) and [dogs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0450.2006.00932.x).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Corvallis has been found [globally](https://onehealthadv.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44280-023-00017-9) such as the UK and the US.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> Four *Salmonella* isolates were obtained from the lunch including three Brandenburg isolates from three dishes and one Corvallis isolate from another dish.


## Border Rejections

There have been no recent border rejections linked to this serovar.


## Recalls

There have been no recent recalls linked to this serovar.
