## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Muenchen (antigenic formula 6,8:d:1,2) is a serovar of the O:8 (C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Muenchen was first described in [1932](https://boneandjoint.org.uk/Article/10.1302/0301-620X.46B4.697/pdf) and the first records of its isolation were documented in South and North America. Serovar Muenchen is one of the [top 10 serovars](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/152398/cdc_152398_DS1.pdf) responsible for human salmonellosis cases in US. [CDC surveillance data](https://web.archive.org/web/20030315113355/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/phlisdata/salmtab/2001/SalmonellaAnnualSummary2001.pdf) indicated that serovar Muenchen represents approximately 2% of salmonellosis infections, ranking eighth among the leading *Salmonella* serovars. Since 2019, serovar Muenchen has been the most predominant serovar in [Israel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X22002889), identified in clinical, poultry, and food samples. It accounted for over 30% (937 of 3,112) of all clinical *Salmonella* isolates in 2019 and 39.5% (1,055 of 2,671) in 2020. This serovar was also the [most common serovar in beef](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00591-19) in Oceania. Between 2001 and 2007, serovar Muenchen ranked as the [15th most frequently isolated](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2010.0787?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) *Salmonella* serovar from humans across 37 countries participating in the WHO Global Foodborne Infections Network laboratory surveillance program.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Muenchen has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with four lineages identified. [Cohen et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X22002889?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=938b7e23da1ae8a6) revealed that the emergence of serovar Muenchen was characterized by a predominant clonal multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain carrying the epidemic megaplasmid pESI. This plasmid confers resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin (*aadA1*), sulfonamides (*sul1*), tetracycline (*tetRA*), and trimethoprim (*dfrA1*), and demonstrates self-mobilization capability to *E. coli* and other *Salmonella* serovars. Notably, pESI also harbors multiple virulence determinants, including: (1) two chaperone-usher fimbrial clusters (Ipf and Klf); (2) a mercury resistance operon; and (3) the yersiniabactin iron acquisition system - all likely contributing to enhanced pathogenicity, host specificity, and environmental persistence. While initially reported in Israel, pESI-positive serovar Muenchen strains have now been identified in additional geographic regions such as South Africa, the UK, and US. [Another Israeli study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/19490976.2024.2369339?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#abstract) revealed that yersiniabactin gene cluster in pESI demonstrated specific upregulation under two key conditions: (1) mid-to-late logarithmic growth phase and (2) iron-depleted or oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) environments. Their findings revealed yersiniabactin's novel function in oxidative stress resistance and demonstrated its substantial contribution to serovar Infantis/Muenchen gut colonization in murine, promoting the worldwide transmission of pESI-bearing strains across diverse *Salmonella* lineages.

## Animal Reservoir

[Swine](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/swine2006_is_salmonella_1.pdf), [cattle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4825103/), and [poultry](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/22161) are reservoirs for serovar Muenchen. This serovar was also isolated from [other animals such as raccoons and reptile](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Muenchen%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Muenchen has been found [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Muenchen%22)>).
