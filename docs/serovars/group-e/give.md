## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Give (antigenic formula: 3,{10}{15}{15,34}:l,v:1,7) is a serovar of the O:3,10 (E<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. This serovar has been reported to cause [brain abscess and bacteremia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38176586/) in a 3-year old female child. Serovar Give was associated with [a cattle outbreak](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5464488/), but further details regarding the incident are unavailable.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Give has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. In a [Venezuela](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24187555/) study, the bla<sub>TEM-1</sub> and bla<sub>SHV-12</sub> genes were identified in *S.* Give SG9611, while bla<sub>TEM-1</sub> and bla<sub>CTX-M-2</sub> were found in the other three strains: *S.* Give SG9811, *S.* Heidelberg SH7511, and SH7911. Notably, the *qnrB19* gene was detected in all four strains, irrespective of their origin or serovars. In an [outbreak study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/national-outbreak-of-salmonella-give-linked-to-a-local-food-manufacturer-in-malta-october-2016/F086A81E491E0272ABE4869A7C62DD60), all human isolates analyzed in clusters 1 and 2 through MLST exhibited resistance to monoglucoside. In [pig farms in Ibadan, Nigeria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12223-013-0270-6), the majority of the multidrug-resistant isolates were *S.* Give, comprising 24 isolates (47.1%), which exhibited co-resistance to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline.

## Animal Reservoir

Unknown but serovar Give has previously been isolated in [livestock such as cattle, pigs, and exotic animals such as camels](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/national-outbreak-of-salmonella-give-linked-to-a-local-food-manufacturer-in-malta-october-2016/F086A81E491E0272ABE4869A7C62DD60#ref6).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Give has been reported [worldwide such as the UK and the US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Give%22)>).
