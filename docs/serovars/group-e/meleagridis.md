## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Meleagridis (antigenic formula 3,{10}{15}{15,34}:e,h:l,w) is a serovar of the O:3,10 (E<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report stated that, from [1981 to 1982](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000176.htm), infections caused by serovar Meleagridis increased dramatically in US, climbing from 32 to 151-a 372% rise. An [Iraqi](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/453836/)study found that among 700 animal feed samples tested, 4.5% (32 samples) contained *Salmonella*, and serovar Meleagridis was the predominant serotype identified. In Yucatan, Mexico, serovar Meleagridis ([11.6% of isolates](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16323087/)) was the second most prevalent *Salmonella* serotype isolated from asymptomatic children. By collecting fecal samples from representative cows in 97 dairy herds across 21 states in US, [Blau et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X22009826?via%3Dihub) found that serovar Meleagridis (24.1%) was the most frequently recovered serotypes.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Meleagridis has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Meleagridis isolates. [Zhang et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113524000154?via%3Dihub) analyzed a total of 61 Chinese Meleagridis isolates from various sources (primarily from pigs and pig-related products) and revealed that those isolates were clustered into two groups by using CRISPR typing. Using cgMLST, the Chinese isolates were grouped into a unique Cluster C. They also found that spacer SoeB5 served as the sole marker distinguishing MCT1 and MCT2 isolates within Cluster I. An AMR IncR plasmid was present in 70.5% of the Chinese Meleagridis isolates.

## Animal Reservoir

[Pig](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113524000154?via%3Dihub) is the reservoir for serovar Meleagridis. This serovar was frequently isolated from [cattle](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15830658/)as well.

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Meleagridis has been reported [worldwide occasionally, but primarily in US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Meleagridis%22)>). Among a total of 1,128 serovar Meleagridis isolates available in NCBI PD (accessed 04/24/2025), 813 were collected in US.
