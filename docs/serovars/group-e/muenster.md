## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Muenster (antigenic formula 3,{10}{15}{15,34}:e,h:1,5) is a serovar of the O:3,10 (E1) serogroup. The serovars previously known as [Newhaw and Arkansas](https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf) are now classified as variants of serovar Muenster. Newhaw is designated as Muenster var. 15^+^ (converted by phage =CE=B515), while Arkansas is Muenster var. 15^+^,34^+^ (converted by phages =CE=B515 and =CE=B534). These variants occupy the same serological position as group O:4 (B) strains, which express factor 1 upon conversion but had not been assigned new names. During 1986, *Salmonella* spp. (primarily serovar Muenster) was detected in [2.9% of raw milk samples](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1255394/) from dairy herds in southwestern Ontario, but the prevalence declined to [zero within approximately a year](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X22090214?via%3Dihub). According to the [1996 USDA prevalence study](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dairy96_is_ecoli_salm.pdf), serovar Muenster ranked as the seventh most frequent serotype, representing 4.7% of all *Salmonella* spp. isolates in US dairy operations. Serovar Muenster can cause [abortion or diarrhea in cows](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC339296/) in late gestation.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Muenster has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with two lineages identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Muenster isolates. [Chang et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35464949/) found an Muenster isolate with a 260-kb *bla* CTX-M-55-*qnrS1*-bearing IncHI2 plasmid. [Argentinian researchers](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19642916/) reported that serovar Muenster had low pathogenic potential in swine. [Osman et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23621859/) revealed that 2 out of 5 Muenster isolates included in their study exhibited resistance to lincomycin, streptomycin and chloramphenicol. [Nguyen et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/45/3/143) collected a total of 47 duck carcass samples in wet markets during October 2019 in Vietnam and isolated seven strains of serovar Muenster belonging to** **ST 321. Among these seven isolates, three of them harbored C63PI, an iron transport system located in SPI-1. Three plasmid replicons were identified in these Muenster isolates (IncHI2_1, IncHI2A_1, and IncL/M(pMU407)_1_pMU407). All seven isolates exhibited ESBL phenotypes and carried the *blaCTX-M-55* variants (i.e., *blaTEM-1B, blaCTX-M-55, blaTEM-206, blaTEM-214, and blaTEM-141*).

## Animal Reservoir

 [Dairy cattle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC339296/) is the reservoir for serovar Muenster. This serovar was also isolated from other animals such as [pet bearded dragons, and birds (*Tympanuchus cupido*, *Antigone canadensis*)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Muenster%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 According to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Muenster has been reported [globally but primarily in US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Muenster%22)). Among a total of 2,659 serovar Muenster isolates available in NCBI PD (accessed 04/29/2025), there were 2,040 isolates collected in US.
