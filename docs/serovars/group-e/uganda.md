## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Uganda (antigenic formula: 3,{10},{15}:1,z<sub>13</sub>:1,5) is a Group O:3,10 (E1) serovar. In US, human infections caused by serovar Uganda are uncommon. Between [1993 and 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20040606215720/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/phlisdata/salmonella.htm#2001), an average of only 48 human cases were reported annually.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Uganda has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). In a [Nigerian study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4774774/), four serovar Uganda strains were isolated from camels slaughtered in Maiduguri central abattoir and one of strains showed resistance to sulfamethoxazole. Serovar Uganda isolated from fish in India harbored [multiple virulence genes](https://ijmr.org.in/salmonella-enterica-serovars-takoradi-tananarive-and-uganda-from-foods-in-tripura-their-virulence-antimicrobial-resistance/), including *orgA* (oxygen-regulated, involved in host recognition and invasion), *invE/A* (SPI-1, essential for host cell invasion), *ttrC* (tetrathionate reductase, conferring a fitness advantage), *ssaQ* (SPI-2 T3SS secretion system component), *mgtC* (SPI-3, promoting intracellular survival in macrophages via Mg²⁺ transport), *misL* (SPI-3-encoded autotransporter adhesin, aiding intramacrophage survival), *spi4R/spi4D* (encoding a T1SS), *sopB* (SPI-1/SPI-5 T3SS effector facilitating bacterial internalization), pip (SPI-5 protein inducing intestinal inflammation and fluid secretion), *hilA* (SPI-1 T3SS regulator enhancing invasiveness), and *stn* (Salmonella enterotoxin), and *pefA* (fimbrial virulence factors). [Brichta-Harhay et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01885-10) studied cattle processing plants in US and found the most prevalent multidrug-resistant (MDR) *Salmonella *serotypes identified were *Salmonella* Newport (53.1%), Typhimurium (16.6%), and Uganda (10.9%). All MDR serovar Uganda isolates in their study exhibited resistance to cephalosporins (ceftiofur and cefoxitin), along with either reduced susceptibility or full resistance to ceftriaxone.


## Animal Reservoir

Unknown, according to the metadata from NCBI PD, [cattle and pigs](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Uganda%22)>) are potential reservoirs for serovar Uganda. Pigs and cattle remained the top two sources for non-human isolates.


## Geographical Distribution

According to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Uganda has been reported [worldwide but primarily in US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Uganda%22)>) (2,528 out of 3,310 serovar Uganda isolates available in NCBI PD were from US, accessed 06/01/2025).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> Both *Salmonella* Uganda and *Salmonella* Idikan were isolated.


## Border Rejections

<sup>1</sup> Consignment was released later.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> This recall was caused by a outbreak described above. Stallings Head Cheese Co., Inc., a Houston, Texas establishment, issued a recall of 4,700 pounds of their hog head cheese.
