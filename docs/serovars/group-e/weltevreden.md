## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Weltevreden (antigenic formula 3,{10}{15}:r:z6) is a serovar of the O:3,10 (E1) serogroup. Serovar Weltevreden has been reported to cause [myocarditis](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2025.1513974/full) in a case from South India. In [Malaysia](https://pascal-francis.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=3032864), serovar Weltevreden became a more frequent cause of human gastroenteritis, representing 31% of all detected serovars from 1989 to 1994. [Tran et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15353859/) reported a low prevalence of serovar Weltevreden in domestic chickens, ducks, and pigs in the Mekong Delta. The rising association between serovar Weltevreden and human salmonellosis cases in Southeast Asia aligns with its [frequent isolation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31053586/) in the region's seafood.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Weltevreden has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A clonal group of serovar Weltevreden isolated in [farmed shrimp from Vietnam's Mekong Delta](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134252) showed susceptibility to most tested antimicrobials, though some isolates exhibited resistance to florfenicol, chloramphenicol, sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim. However, all serovar Weltevreden isolates (100%) collected from [wild geckos in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnamwere](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/zph.12873) were pan-susceptible. An [India study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0064#:~:text=In%20the%20last%20two%20decades,et%20al.%2C%202021).) found that all *Salmonella* Weltevreden strains isolated in their study carried virulence genes associated with *Salmonella* Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs), including *invA/E*, *orgA*, *ttrC*, *ssaQ*, *mgtC*, *misL*, and *spi4D*), as well as the enterotoxin gene (*stn*) and the hyperinvasive locus gene (*hilA*). With the exception of erythromycin resistance, all strains showed susceptibility to standard antimicrobials used in diarrhea treatment.

All sequenced serovar Weltevreden isolates in a [Danish study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01985/full) collected from cultured shrimp and tilapia in Vietnam and China belonged to ST365 and carried key virulence genes located within SPI 1–5. Ten isolates possessed the *Inc*FII(S) plasmid, similar to the virulence-associated plasmid pSPCV found in *S.* Paratyphi C, while one isolate contained an *Inc*Q1 plasmid co-located with resistance genes (*strA/B*, *sul2*, *tetA*), similar to the *Inc*Q1-type plasmid pNUC in *S*. Typhimurium. Pangenome analysis identified 7,891 genes, with a core genome of 4,892 genes, showing highly similar accessory genomes between clinical and environmental isolates. Additionally, serovar Weltevreden featured unique genomic regions containing *glpX* (class II fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), *rfbC* (dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose 3,5-epimerase), and *cmtB* (mannitol-specific PTS enzyme IIA component), which are involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis pathways.

[Zhang et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9927414/) revealed that most serovar Weltevreden strains from diarrheal patients in China (97.92%, 94/96) and other global regions (94.97%, 189/199) belonged to ST 365. The remaining strains in their study were identified as ST3771 (n=3), ST22 (n=1), ST155 (n=1), and ST684 (n=1). Additionally, ST365 was commonly found in animals, food, and environmental samples worldwide. These serovar Weltevreden strains harbored multiple virulence genes, and a 100.03-kb *Inc*FII(S) plasmid was frequently present. Removing this plasmid reduced the bacteria's ability to infect Caco-2 cells and C57BL/6 mice. Interestingly, a study found that serovar Weltevreden exhibits [higher expression](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26531707/) of the enterotoxin *stn* gene when cultured in seafood.

## Animal Reservoir

 [Wild geckos](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/zph.12873) are likely to be the reservoir for serovar Weltevreden. Serovar Weltevreden was also frequently reported from [seafood](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01985/full).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Weltevreden has been found [worldwide](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9927414/). Over the past 20 years, *Salmonell*a Weltevreden has become a predominant serovar, particularly in [Southeast Asia, including countries such as Oman, Singapore, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and India](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0064#:~:text=In%20the%20last%20two%20decades,et%20al.%2C%202021).).
