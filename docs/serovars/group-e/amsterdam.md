## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Amsterdam (antigenic formula 3,{10}{15}{15,34}:g,m,s:–) is a serovar of the O:3,10 (E1) serogroup.

%20AND%20serovar:(%22Amsterdam%22))

## Genetic Characteristics

 A total of 63 serovar Amsterdam isolates have been retrieved in meat-type ducks raised in a Thailand farm by [Assawatheptawee et al](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9445369/). All these isolates were positive for the virulence genes *sipB*, *prgH*, *spaN*, *orgA*, *spiA*, *pagC*, *msgA*, *sitC*, *invA*, and *sopB*, but negative for *pefA* and *spvB*. The *sifA* gene was also absent. In a another study, *Salmonella* Amsterdam isolated from [beef in Greater Tunis (n=2)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174016301371) has been found to possess the invasion gene *invA*, but none the *spvC* virulence gene. These two isolates were also found to show multidrug-resistance.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, but serovar Amsterdam was found in [rats](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6358699/), [cobras (*Naja kaouthia*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22362530/), and [ducks](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9445369/). According to the metadata from NCBI PD, it was also found in [pigs and cattle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20serovar:(%22Amsterdam%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Amsterdam has been reported primarily in [European countries such as the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden](https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/sp.efsa.2021.EN-6922#:~:text=Abstract,No%20deaths%20have%20been%20reported.). According to the metadata from NCBI PD, it has also been found occasionally in [North America (US and Canada), Asia (Philippines and Thailand), and Australia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20serovar:(%22Amsterdam%22)).
