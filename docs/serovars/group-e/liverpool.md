## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Liverpool (antigenic formula 1,3,19:d:e,n,z<sub>15</sub>) is a serovar of the O:1,3,19 (E<sub>4</sub>) serogroup. In the [2021 Salmonella outbreak linked to BrightFarms packaged salad greens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37003534/), one serovar Liverpool isolate with no illnesses linked was recovered from two indoor growing ponds within the same growing house.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Liverpool has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Liverpool isolates. In an Algerian study, serovar Liverpool isolates they identified belong to sequence types [ST1959](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38502796/). Due to the limited genetic characteristics available for this serovar, here, we also incorporated relevant phenotypic characteristics. [Estrada and Harris](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38493873/) found that serovar Liverpool strain A (persistent) in their study produced a robust biofilm. Amongst all the isolates [Obe et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056617121000581) tested with MIC QAC of 6.25 ppm before exposure, they found that compared to Kentucky and Enteritidis isolates (2-fold), serovar Liverpool isolate had the highest increment (3-fold) in MIC.


## Animal Reservoir

Unknown, [ cattle ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17257247/)and [poultry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579120303540) may be potential reservoirs for serovar Liverpool.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Liverpool has been reported occasionally [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Liverpool%22)>), but according to NCBI PD (accessed April 15, 2025), the majority of serovar Liverpool isolates originate from [US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Liverpool%22)>) (591 out of 739).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> Investigation is still ongoing.


## Border Rejections

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella* Liverpool and* Salmonella* Agona were both found.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella* Senftenberg and *Salmonella* Liverpool were found.

<sup>2</sup> *Salmonella* Senftenberg and *Salmonella *Liverpool were found. Trader Joe’s branded pistachios were recalled.

<sup>3</sup> Diamond Pet Foods issued a recall of Diamond Naturals Small Breed Adult Lamb and Rice Dry Dog Food.
