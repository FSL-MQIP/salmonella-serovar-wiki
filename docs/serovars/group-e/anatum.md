## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Anatum (antigenic formula 3,{10}{15}{15,34}:e,h:1,6) is a serovar of the O:3,10 (E1) serogroup. Serovar Anatum was first isolated from ducklings in the United States in [1920](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jb.30.3.269-276.1935) by Rettger and Scoville. Serovar Anatum has been reported as one of the top 20 *Salmonella* serotypes in the United States.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Anatum has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). [Feng et al.](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/12/20-0147_article) concluded that a *Salmonella* Anatum outbreak in Taiwan was caused by a multidrug-resistant clone possessing *bla*<sub>CMY-2</sub>–carrying plasmid (90-kb IncA/C plasmid). They also found that the entire collection of clinical *Salmonella* Anatum isolates belonged to sequence type 64, as determined by MLST. [Zhao et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11014889/) revealed that the mutations found in the phage-resistant Anatum strains were associated with several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to membrane components.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Anatum was found primarily in[ cattle ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6606869/)but was also present in other livestock such as [chicken, turkey, sheep, and pigs. Dogs and horses](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Anatum%22)>) are also potential reservoirs.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Anatum has been reported[ worldwide ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6606869/)such as the US, China, and South Africa.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Multiple human outbreaks associated with serovar Anatum have been reported. A few examples are shown below.


## Border Rejections

Numerous border rejections associated with serovar Anatum have been reported. Here we selected two as examples.

<sup>1</sup> Three serovars including serovar Anatum, Brancaster and Montevideo were found.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> This recall was resulted by one of four separate multistate outbreaks identified in 2017 related to imported Maradol papayas from four different farms in Mexico. The recalled papayas, which were labeled by the packer Frutas Selectas de Tijuana, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, were distributed to markets in California from August 10 to 29, 2017.
