## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica *subsp.* enterica* serovar Senftenberg (antigenic formula: 1,3,19:g,[s],t:-) is a serovar of the O:1,3,19 (E4) serogroup. While *S.* Senfenberg is a rare serovar in human cases (only 7 cases in 10 years in the US), it has been linked with several outbreaks. This serovar is though, very common in animals and food. In the US *S*. Senftenberg is among the top 5 serovars isolated from food, and among the [top 11 serovars isolated from clinical animals](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.979790/full). Among source of outbreaks are contaminated basil and alfalfa sprouts.


## Genetic Characteristics

*Salmonella *Senftenberg is a [ polyphyletic ](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full)serovar, consisting of two lineages and two singleton isolates that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella *Senftenberg isolates. Although antimicrobial resistance is not widespread in *Salmonella *Senftenberg, an extended-spectrum, ß-lactamase strain was linked to infections of patients in a [hospital in India](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670198903073?via%3Dihub). Multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates have also been isolated from production animals in the USA (resistant to [multiple drugs](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.979790/full), including [extended-spectrum cephalosporin](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299354)). [ Carriage ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740002022001368?via%3Dihub)of the pESI-like megaplasmid, which is associated with *Salmonella *Infantis, has been [ linked ](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0299354)to these MDR isolates. It has been suggested that *Salmonella *Seftenberg isolates may be [more heat-resistant](https://actavetscand.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0147-44-1) when compared to other *Salmonella *serovars.


## Animal Reservoir

Turkey and swine are potential reservoirs of *Salmonella *Senftenberg, but this serovar has also been found in other animals, such as chicken and cattle.


## Geographical Distribution

This serovar is widely distributed, and it has been isolated from all inhabited continents.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> The recall was caused by a multistate outbreak described above.
