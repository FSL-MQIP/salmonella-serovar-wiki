## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Enteritidis (antigenic formula 1,9,12:g,m:- ) is a serovar of the O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. This serovar is mainly associated with [table eggs and chickens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19207743/). Eggs can become contaminated either through penetration of the eggshell by *Salmonella *Enteritidis from the colonized gut or contaminated feces during or after oviposition (horizontal transmission). Alternatively, contamination can occur via direct infection of the yolk, albumen, eggshell membranes, or eggshells before oviposition, which results from the infection of reproductive organs with this serovar (vertical transmission). Since the [1990s](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotype-snapshots.html#:~:text=Salmonella%20Enteritidis%2C%20one%20of%20the,it%20infects%20the%20new%20chick.), infection rates have dropped as the egg industry implemented voluntary controls on egg flocks and consumers have reduced their consumption of raw eggs. However, large outbreaks have still occurred. According to the [World Health Organization](<https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/salmonella-(non-typhoidal)>), it is the most common serovar reported from human salmonellosis cases in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia.


## Genetic Characteristics

This serovar is further classified according to the susceptibility to typing phages (phage typing ([PT](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1757554))), the most common PTs are PT8 and PT4. Molecular subtyping with Pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) shows that approx. 40% of the isolates fall in the same PFGE type. [Invasive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19591599) strains of serovar Enteritidis emerged in sub-Sahara regions of Africa and have caused systemic salmonellosis in travelers returning from Africa. Serovar [Nitra](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.02347-10) and Enteritidis have antigenic formulas that differ only in their O antigens. Although serovar Nitra is very rare, it is [genetically indistinguishable](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/9/13-1095_article) from serovar Enteritidis. [Chen et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24) found that *Salmonella* Enteritidis is a polyphyletic serovar comprised of six phylogenetic groups and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Enteritidis isolates. Within Enteritidis-A-7 (chicken-associated; estimated emergence in 1633), they identified four clonal sub-clades. [Cao et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24150-4) analyzed Enteritidis isolates collected worldwide from humans and concluded that in clades I and IV, most isolates were pan-susceptible, while 81.8% (9/11) of isolates in clade III and 22.4% (13/58) in clade II were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Notably, 77% (10/13) of the MDR isolates in clade II originated from China. The most common antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) found in the Chinese isolates were *aph(3′)-IIa*, *bla<sub>CTX-M-55</sub>*, and *bla<sub>TEM-1B</sub>*, whereas the most prevalent ARGs in the African isolates (clade III) were *bla<sub>TEM-1B</sub>*, *sul1*, *sul2*, *drfA7*, *aph(3")-Ib/strA*, and *aph(6)-Id/strB*. Of the 14 plasmid types identified, IncX1 and IncFII(pHN7A8) were exclusive to the Chinese MDR isolates, while IncQ1 was strongly linked to the African MDR isolates. A [Chinese study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1158888/full) revealed that serovar Enteritidis triggers an inflammatory response through SPI-1 and SPI-2, which enhances intracellular proliferation and bacterial virulence. A [protein–protein interaction prediction](https://www.dovepress.com/the-resistance-and-virulence-characteristics-of-salmonella-enteritidis-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR) revealed a connection between virulence proteins and T3SS proteins, with PagN interacting with T3SS-related proteins to collectively mediate the invasion of the Enteritidis 27A strain into the human body.


## Animal Reservoir

[Chicken](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15095196/) is the main reservoir. Serovar Enteritidis is also found in [low percentage (<1%) in turkey, cattle](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Enteritidis%22)>), and [dogs](https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.13174).


## Geographical Distribution

The distribution of serovar Enteritidis is [global](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25319-7).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Numerous Enteritidis outbreaks have been reported and they are mainly associated with eggs or poultry. Below are some examples.

<sup>1</sup> Multiple serovars, including *Salmonella* Altona, Cerro, Enteritidis, Indiana, Infantis, Johannesburg, Mbandaka, and Typhimurium, were linked to this outbreak. The case number represents the total number of cases associated with the outbreak and does not specifically indicate the number of people infected by *Salmonella* Enteritidis.

<sup>2 </sup>Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK, and potentially Croatia

<sup>3 </sup>112 confirmed, 148 probable


## Border Rejections

There are numerous border rejections linked to *Salmonella* Enteritidis. The majority of them are associated with chicken, eggs, and egg products, while a few can also be related to other commodities. Below are examples.
