## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Dublin (antigenic formula 1,9,12[Vi]:g,p:-) is a serovar of the O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Dublin is a serovar [adapted to cattle](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1331767/full), which is the primary host, but it can also infect and cause disease in different hosts, including humans. In cattle, serovar Dublin causes acute and subclinical disease; symptoms of salmonellosis in cattle include: fever, diarrhea, abortions, respiratory signs (especially in calves), and systemic disease, thus making serovar Dublin an important economic concern in the bovine industry. Serovar Dublin is a zoonosis that causes one of the [ highest rates of systemic disease ](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/9/17-0136_article)among all non-typhoidal salmonellosis cases in humans. Similar to *Salmonella* Choleraesuis, serovar Dublin infections in humans were linked to a [higher incidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2030643/) of bacteremia (91%), metastatic infections (30%), and mortality rates (26%) compared to other non-typhoidal *Salmonella* serovars. In the U.S., *S.* Dublin is the second most common *Salmonella* serovar among clinical non-human sources.


## Genetic Characteristics

In 2012, [the Animal Health Diagnostic Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20130414051934/http://ahdc.vet.cornell.edu/docs/Salmonella_Dublin_in_Cattle_Health_Alert.pdf) at Cornell University published an animal health advisory that indicated an increase in the isolation of multidrug resistant strains of serovar Dublin in New York. Among ceftriaxone-resistant *Salmonella* isolates reported by the [National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)](https://web.archive.org/web/20201023041517/https://www.cdc.gov/narms/pdf/2014-annual-report-narms-508c.pdf), serovar Dublin represents the 40.8% and 2.9% of isolates from cattle and humans, respectively. *Salmonella* Dublin was identified as a [ monophyletic serovar ](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)with its largest lineage (Dublin 2-3) containing clonal sub-clades enriched for human isolates. [Wallis et al. ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7790094/)suggested that the *Salmonella* virulence plasmid does not play a role in the enteric phase of infection or the systemic spread of *S.* dublin; however, it likely facilitates the bacterium's persistence at systemic sites. Meanwhile, [Libby et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9125562/) found that calves infected with the wild type or the complemented *spvR* mutant rapidly developed severe diarrhea and became moribund, whereas those infected with the *spvR* mutant exhibited little to no clinical signs of systemic salmonellosis and only mild diarrhea, indicating the spv genes of *S.* dublin facilitate increased intracellular proliferation within intestinal tissues and at extraintestinal sites in cattle. [Mohammed et al.](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-017-2628-x) claimed that several virulence factors such as Gifsy-2 prophage, SPI-6, SPI-19, *ggt* and *PagN* in the genome of *S. *Dublin may contribute to its ability to invade the human bloodstream; however, no specific genomic markers distinguish invasive from non-invasive isolates, indicating that the host immune response likely plays a critical role in determining the clinical outcome of* S.* Dublin infection.


## Animal Reservoir

[Cattle](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1331767/full) is the reservoir of this serovar, but it can cause disease in other animals, such as [dogs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zph.13174), as well.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Dublin has been reported [ worldwide ](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/digestive-system/salmonellosis/salmonella-dublin-infection-in-cattle)such as the US and the UK.

Animal outbreaks:

<sup>1</sup> Each farm typically houses around 1,000 breeding females.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Several reports of outbreaks associated with *Salmonella* Dublin in humans have been documented. These outbreaks are primarily linked to the consumption of raw milk or products made from raw milk. Below are examples.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> France issued a press release with a public warning, while Spain announced a withdrawal of the product from the market.

<sup>2</sup> Central Valley Meat Co. in Hanford, California, issued a recall of 34,222 pounds of ground beef that may be contaminated with *Salmonella* Dublin. This recall was caused by a multistate outbreak of *Salmonella *Dublin infections linked to ground beef which was described above.
