## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Gallinarum (antigenic formula 1,9,12:–:–) is a serovar of the O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. This serovar has two biovars: Gallinarum, and Pullorum. Biovar Gallinarum has been found to show host specificity for [aquatic birds, and poultry](<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10812584/#:~:text=Salmonella%20enterica%20subsp.,disease%20(PD)%2C%20respectively>) and can cause [fowl typhoid (FT) in birds of any age, often spreading through adult flocks](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001653?crawler=true#:~:text=Both%20biovars%20cause%20invasive%20and,often%20progresses%20through%20mature%20flocks.). FT can spread through [ingestion, such as contaminated food, water, or cannibalism, as well as through the respiratory system](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/fowl_typhoid.pdf). [Live attenuated vaccines (SG9R)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056617119304234#:~:text=Live%20attenuated%20vaccines%20were%20first,except%20for%20the%20SG9R%20strain.) to prevent FT were first created in 1956 with the development of the Gallinarum rough strain. Since serovar Gallinarum relies solely on domestic and aquatic fowl as its reservoir, as a result, the test-and-slaughter approach implemented through surveillance programs successfully eradicated the serovar from commercial poultry flocks in [the United States](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1589326?origin=crossref), [England, and Wales by the 1970s](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/20063033929).


## Genetic Characteristics

Studies have found that isolates from biovar Gallinarum can be multidrug-resistant. More specifically, antibiogram analysis revealed that biovar Gallinarum in the U.S. exhibited high prevalence of resistance to [cephradine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, streptomycin, and ampicillin](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/acmi/10.1099/acmi.0.000775.v6). Farahani et al. found that the antibiotic resistance rates among 60 biovar Gallinarum isolates in Iran were as follows: [penicillin (100%), nitrofurantoin (80%), nalidixic acid (45%), cefoxitin (35%), neomycin sulfate (30%), chloramphenicol (20%), and ciprofloxacin (5%)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10628085/#:~:text=This%20study%20showed%20a%20positive,gallinarum%20biovars%20are%20multidrug%2Dresistant.).


## Animal Reservoir

[Chickens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444525123001832) are the primary hosts for biovar Gallinarum, although other bird species can also be affected. Besides chickens, biovar Gallinarum has been reported in [turkeys, quail, guinea fowl, pheasants, peafowl, grouse, parrots, sparrows, ostriches, and ring-necked doves](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/media/fowl_typhoid.pdf).


## Geographical Distribution

Biovar Gallinarum has been reported [worldwide](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01605-x).

Animal outbreaks: There have been multiple outbreaks in chickens associated with biovar Gallinarum. Examples are shown below:

<sup>1</sup> The flock size is 400, and 222 birds died.

<sup>2 </sup>The flock size is 10,000, and 2,400 birds died.
