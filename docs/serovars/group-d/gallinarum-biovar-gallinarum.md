**Background information:** *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Gallinarum (antigenic formula 1,9,12:–:–) is a serovar of the O:9 (D1) serogroup. This serovar has two biovars: Gallinarum, and Pullorum. Biovar Gallinarum has been found to show host specificity for [aquatic birds, and poultry](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10812584/#:~:text=Salmonella%20enterica%20subsp.,disease%20(PD)%2C%20respectively) and can cause [fowl typhoid (FT) in birds of any age, often spreading through adult flocks](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.001653?crawler=true#:~:text=Both%20biovars%20cause%20invasive%20and,often%20progresses%20through%20mature%20flocks.). FT can spread through [ingestion, such as contaminated food, water, or cannibalism, as well as through the respiratory system](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/fowl_typhoid.pdf). [Live attenuated vaccines (SG9R)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1056617119304234#:~:text=Live%20attenuated%20vaccines%20were%20first,except%20for%20the%20SG9R%20strain.) to prevent FT were first created in 1956 with the development of the Gallinarum rough strain. Since serovar Gallinarum relies solely on domestic and aquatic fowl as its reservoir, as a result, the test-and-slaughter approach implemented through surveillance programs successfully eradicated the serovar from commercial poultry flocks in [the United States](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1589326?origin=crossref), [England, and Wales by the 1970s](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/20063033929).

In silico serotyping tools used by NCBI PD cannot differentiate between Gallinarum and Enteritidis, nor can they distinguish at the biovar level. Additional genetic features need to be incorporated for accurate serotyping. %20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Gallinarum%20or%20Enteritidis%22))

## Genetic Characteristics

Studies have found that isolates from biovar Gallinarum can be multidrug-resistant. More specifically, antibiogram analysis revealed that biovar Gallinarum in the U.S. exhibited high prevalence of resistance to [cephradine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, streptomycin, and ampicillin](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/acmi/10.1099/acmi.0.000775.v6). Farahani et al. found that the antibiotic resistance rates among 60 biovar Gallinarum isolates in Iran were as follows: [penicillin (100%), nitrofurantoin (80%), nalidixic acid (45%), cefoxitin (35%), neomycin sulfate (30%), chloramphenicol (20%), and ciprofloxacin (5%)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10628085/#:~:text=This%20study%20showed%20a%20positive,gallinarum%20biovars%20are%20multidrug%2Dresistant.).

## Animal Reservoir

 [Chickens](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444525123001832) are the primary hosts for biovar Gallinarum, although other bird species can also be affected. Besides chickens, biovar Gallinarum has been reported in [turkeys, quail, guinea fowl, pheasants, peafowl, grouse, parrots, sparrows, ostriches, and ring-necked doves](https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/media/fowl_typhoid.pdf).

## Geographical Distribution

 Biovar Gallinarum has been reported [worldwide](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01605-x).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

 There have been multiple outbreaks in chickens associated with biovar Gallinarum. Examples are shown below:
