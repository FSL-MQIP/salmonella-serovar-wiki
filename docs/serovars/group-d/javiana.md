## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Javiana (antigenic formula 1,9,12:l,z<sub>28</sub>:1,5) is a serovar of the O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Javiana remains [one of the top five most common](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3622996/) serotypes of *Salmonella* linked fresh-cut produce, with an average of 11 clusters per year (2008 to 2012) identified by the PulseNet Network. Between 1996 and 2007, serovar Javiana ranked as the [fifth most common](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6719869/) *Salmonella* serovars reported to the CDC, but it rose to fourth place in 2008 representing 5% of overall salmonellosis cases in the US.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Javiana has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). [Mezal et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160513001670) found a total of 34 distinct patterns grouped into five clusters at a 90% similarity threshold using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Among the 50 Javiana isolates studied, all carried seven virulence genes, including *cdtB*. Additionally, the Javiana isolates exhibited substantial genetic diversity, indicating a heterogeneous clonal population across clinical, food, and environmental samples. Antimicrobial resistance in serovar Javiana was relatively low. Among the [140 isolates analyzed in 2013](https://www.cdc.gov/narms/reports/annual-human-isolates-report-2013.html), only four (6.6%) exhibited resistance to nalidixic acid, while all remained susceptible to ceftriaxone. Notably, none of the isolates were classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR). In addition, serovar Javiana is primarily regarded as pansusceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. According to the [U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) surveillance dashboard](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/national-antimicrobial-resistance-monitoring-system/narms-now-integrated-data), none of the 3,047 serovar Javiana isolates tested between 1996-2024 showed phenotypic resistance to 20 clinically relevant antibiotics. [Sanad et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9611979/) analyzed a total of 409 Javiana isolates and found that a high proportion (89%, n=364) of isolates demonstrated resistance to sulfisoxazole alone. Resistance to other agents (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftiofur) was rare (3%, n=11). PFGE resolved the population into nine major clusters, and isolates sharing XbaI/AvrII profiles were epidemiologically linked to prolonged human circulation. Plasmid analysis of resistant strains (n=19) revealed diverse plasmid sizes (<3–165 kb), while virulence screening confirmed the universal presence of 14 genes, including *pagC*, *cdtB*, and *iroN*. Interestingly, serovar Javiana is known to produce the [typhoid toxin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29588404/). [Miller et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.00467-18?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org) revealed that deletion of the genes encoding the binding subunit (*pltB*) and a bacteriophage-derived muramidase, predicted to facilitate toxin export (*ttsA*), does not eliminate toxin activity in Javiana strains harboring the *S*-CDT operon.

## Animal Reservoir

According to CDC, serovar Javiana is mainly associated with [amphibians](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotype-snapshots.html#:~:text=Scientists%20speculate%20that%20Javiana%20may,native%20to%20specific%20geographic%20areas). This serovar has also been rarely found in [other animals such as chicken, cattle](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Javiana%22)>), and [dogs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zph.13174).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Javiana has been reported [worldwide](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6719869/) including the US, Australia, and Germany.
