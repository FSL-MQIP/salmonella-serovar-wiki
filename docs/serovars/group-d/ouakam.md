## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Ouakam (antigenic formula: 9,46:z<sub>29</sub>:-) is a serovar of the O:9,46 (D<sub>2</sub>) serogroup. In Sweden, serovar Ouakam was reported in [feed mills and humans](https://actavetscand.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1751-0147-52-15). In China, serovar Ouakam was isolated from [healthy food workers](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2024/12/chinese-researchers-find-salmonella-in-healthy-food-workers/). A [Chinese study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X23063731) investigating the prevalence of *Salmonella* in neck skin and bone of chickens found that the majority of the farm isolates belonged to *Salmonella* Kentucky and Ouakam.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Ouakam has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified. Overall, there have only been few reports about resistance in serovar Ouakam. According to a study by Canadian Health Departments, [*bla<sub>CTX-M-1</sub>* genes](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/7/21-1528-t3) which confer resistance to extended-spectrum β-lactams have been found in serovar Ouakam isolated from animal or meat sources. Serovar Ouakam isolates collected from humans in Africa that were examined by Saba et al. were found to be [susceptible to all tested antimicrobials](https://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/24129620). Two other studies have reported (i) one [MDR strain of serovar Ouakam](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113514003538?via%3Dihub) and (ii) [three MDR strains of serovar Ouakam](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6230656/). Both studies attributed the resistance patterns to the presence of a 100 kb plasmid. Similarly, [Peng et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11649994/) revealed that all nine serovar Ouakam isolates obtained from healthy individuals exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR) conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, lincosamides, tetracyclines, beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, quinolones, and rifamycins. These isolates carried the IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid. Additionally, the *astA* gene, encoding the EAST1 toxin, was present in one of serovar Ouakam isolate (Sa17631).

## Animal Reservoir

Unknown, but according to the metadata from NCBI PD (accessed 05/14/2025), [poultry (particularly turkey and chicken)](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Ouakam%22)>) may serve as potential reservoirs, as 175 of 365 serovar Ouakam isolates were obtained from these sources.

## Geographical Distribution

According to the metadata from NCBI PD (accessed 05/14/2025), serovar Ouakam has only been found in [a few countries including (Brazil, US, Canada, UK, China, Thailand, Lebanon, Ghana)](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Ouakam%22)>).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks
