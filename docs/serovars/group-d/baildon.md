## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Baildon (antigenic formula 9,46:​a:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:9,46 (D<sub>2</sub>) serogroup. Over the past five years, serovar Baildon has represented [fewer than 1%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39297648/) of reported salmonellosis cases in the United States.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Baildon has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A non-Baildon serovar, *S*. Worb, clusters within serovar Baildon. [Weissinger et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168160500004153) found the tolerance of serovar Baildon to an acidic pH of 4.5 was unaffected by the pH of the growth medium (4.5, 5.8, or 7.2), indicating that this strain exhibits unique resistance to acidic conditions.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Baildon was found in [cattle, wild boar, American white ibis, and common bottlenose dolphin](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Baildon%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Baildon has been found in the [US, Canada, the UK, Senegal, and Tanzania](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Baildon%22)>).
