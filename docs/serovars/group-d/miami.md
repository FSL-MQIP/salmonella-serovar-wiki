## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Miami (antigenic formula 1,9,12:​a:1,5) is a serovar of the O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovars Miami and Sendai share the same antigenic formula. According to [the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Salmonella at the Pasteur Institute](https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf), serovar Sendai, which is human-adapted, is auxotrophic and cannot grow on a minimal glucose medium or Simmons's citrate agar. In contrast, serovar Miami, being ubiquitous, is prototrophic and thrives on such minimal media. [Fukumi et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13142745/) mentioned that most serovar Miami strains were isolated from cases of acute gastroenteritis or similar conditions.

Genetic characteristics: Serovar Miami has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with seven lineages identified. [Feng et al.](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-5798-7#ref-CR13) revealed that, in terms of genetic content, serovar Miami showed a closer relationship to serovar Panama than to serovar Sendai. In addition, serovar Miami was found to have two CRISPR loci, neither of which matched those found in serovar Sendai or Paratyphi A. However, the nucleotide sequence of Miami’s *fliC* gene was almost identical to Sendai’s. The differing phylogenetic patterns observed in *fliC*, *fliB*, and *fliD* suggest that serovar Miami likely acquired *fliC* through recombination.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Miami was found to be [host-generalist](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-5798-7#ref-CR13). For example, this serovar was previously found in [opossums (Marmosa mitis) from Trinidad and Grenada](https://meridian.allenpress.com/jwd/article/15/2/213/118191/Salmonella-IN-WILDLIFE-FROM-TRINIDAD-AND-GRENADA-W). According to the metadata from NCBI PD, this serovar was isolated from [other wild animals such as southern toad (*Anaxyrus terrestris*), snake (*Boa constrictor*), American alligator (*Alligator mississippiensis*), American white ibis (Eudocimus albus)](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Miami%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Miami has been reported [occasionally worldwide, but primarily in US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Miami%22)>). Among a total of 1,446 serovar Miami isolates available in NCBI PD (accessed 04/23/2025), 1,234 were collected in US.
