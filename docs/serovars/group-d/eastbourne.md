## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Abony (antigenic formula 1,9,12:e,h:1,5) is a serovar of the O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Eastbourne, first identified in England in [1931](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S031554637573804X), was initially isolated in Canada from a human source in 1950 and later from frog legs in 1967. Among reptiles in a zoo education setting, serovar Eastbourne was the predominant serotype ([32%, 22/69](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2012.01521.x#b1)) and has been proposed as a [reptile-associated serotype](https://journals.lww.com/pidj/abstract/1995/11000/reptile_associated_salmonellosis_in_new_york_state.6.aspx).


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Eastbourne has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified.


## Animal Reservoir

[Reptiles](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1863-2378.2012.01521.x) are the potential reservoir for serovar Eastbourne; however, it has been isolated from [chickens, cattle, and swine.](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Eastbourne%22)>)


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Eastbourne has been found in[ Australia, Africa, Europe, and North America including the US and Canada.](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Eastbourne%22)>)
