## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Berta (antigenic formula 1,9,12:[f],g,[t]:–) is a serovar of the group O:9 (D1) serogroup. This serovar is considered rare and is scarcely associated with human cases. It typically causes gastrointestinal food poisoning; however, serious infections such as [myocarditis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26730299/) and [meningitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25263727/) due to this organism have been reported as well. The symptoms of [splenic abscesses](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/13/4/e235318.long) are usually non-specific and include fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.



## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Berta has been found to be [monophyletic](http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/PDFs/salmonella-annual-report-2011-508c.pdf). [Olsen et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2271432/) concluded that strains of serovar Berta collected over a period of 6 years from a well documented natural outbreak in Denmark exhibited moderate to low virulence, with log VC10 values ranging from 3.0 to 4.4 after intraperitoneal challenge in mice. Additionally, following an oral challenge, the maximum CFU in the internal organs of day-old chicks varied between 2 and 4 log10 units.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Berta was found in [cattle, chickens, turkeys, wild boars, dogs, horses, and deer, albeit](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/) at a very low frequency.

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Berta has only been described in [the UK, Denmark, the US and Canada](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).
