## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Berta (antigenic formula 1,9,12:[f],g,[t]:–) is a serovar of the group O:9 (D<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. This serovar is considered rare and is scarcely associated with human cases. It typically causes gastrointestinal food poisoning; however, serious infections such as [myocarditis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26730299/) and [meningitis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25263727/) due to this organism have been reported as well. The symptoms of [splenic abscesses](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/13/4/e235318.long) are usually non-specific and include fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Berta has been found to be [monophyletic](http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/PDFs/salmonella-annual-report-2011-508c.pdf). [Olsen et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2271432/) concluded that strains of serovar Berta collected over a period of 6 years from a well documented natural outbreak in Denmark exhibited moderate to low virulence, with log VC<sub>10</sub> values ranging from 3.0 to 4.4 after intraperitoneal challenge in mice. Additionally, following an oral challenge, the maximum CFU in the internal organs of day-old chicks varied between 2 and 4 log<sub>10</sub> units.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Berta was found in [cattle, chickens, turkeys, wild boars, dogs, horses, and deer, albeit](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Berta%22)>) at a very low frequency.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Berta has only been described in [the UK, Denmark, the US and Canada](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Berta%22)>).
