# *S.* Corvallis

Salmonella Corvallis

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica** *subsp. *enterica* serovar Corvallis (antigenic formula 8,20:z4,z23:[z6]) is a serovar of the O:8 (C2-C3) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from the pooled cecal contents of poults affected with enteritis in the United States in [1949](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jb.58.1.111-112.1949). Higher prevalence of serovar Corvallis was observed in humans and food products in [non-European](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21492021/) countries.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Corvallis has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with six lineages identified. By analyzing 388 Corvallis ST1541 isolates collected globally within a twenty-year period, [Chen et al.](https://onehealthadv.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44280-023-00017-9) found that the ST1541 strains carried ColRNA1 plasmids that contain *qnr*-like determinants. Their Bayesian analysis also inferred that the UK might be the origin of *S.* Corvallis strains currently prevailing in multiple regions. [Fischer et al.](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/68/12/2954/696276?redirectedFrom=fulltext) identified NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing strains isolated from a wild bird in Germany.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Corvallis was found to be associated with[pigs](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/68/12/2954/696276)in South-East Asia. This serovar was also isolated from [chicken](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Corvallis%22)) and [dogs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1439-0450.2006.00932.x).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Corvallis has been found [globally](https://onehealthadv.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44280-023-00017-9) such as the UK and the US.

## Human/Animal Outbreaks
