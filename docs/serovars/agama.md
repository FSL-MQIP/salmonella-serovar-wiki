Salmonella Agama

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Agama (antigenic formula 4,12:i:1,6) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. [In 1956](https://www.nature.com/articles/179164b0), serovar Agama was identified as a new serotype of *Salmonella enterica*, isolated from the feces of the agama lizard (*Agama agama*) in Nigeria. The[first travel-related case](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2738453/)of salmonellosis caused by serovar Agama involved a tourist who had visited Gabon in Central Africa. Serovar Agama has been reported to cause [neonatal meningitis and septicaemia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26255922/).

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Agama has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Agama isolates. In a Nigerian study, serovar Agama isolated from poultry farms exhibited resistance to [ampicillin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6556926/).
