# *S.* Norwich

Salmonella Norwich

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Norwich (antigenic formula 6,7:e,h:1,6) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. Serovar Norwich is uncommon, with only[63 and 102 isolates](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.82.9.1273) recorded in the Public Health Laboratory Information System (PHLIS) for the years 1993 and 1994, respectively.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Norwich has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). [Levent et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00485-21?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed) identified a serovar Norwich strain (ST2119) in cattle feces at slaughter, which contained C63PI, SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-3, SPI-4, SPI-5, SPI-9, SPI-13, and SPI-14 but was missing SPI-8.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, [poultry](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/documents/Risk_Profile_for_Pathogenic_Salmonella_Subtypes_in_Poultry.pdf) may be the potential reservoir for serovar Norwich. This serovar was also isolated from [other animals such as cattle, horses, and dogs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Norwich%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 According to the [metadata from NCBI PD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Norwich%22)), serovar Norwich has only been reported in UK, US and Canada.
