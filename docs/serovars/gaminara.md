# *S.* Gaminara

Salmonella Gaminara

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Gaminara (antigenic formula 16:d:1,7) is a serovar of the O:16 (I) serogroup. This serovar can cause [osteomyelitis and septic arthritis](https://journals.lww.com/infectdis/fulltext/2007/09000/salmonella_gaminara_osteomyelitis_and_septic.13.aspx) in infants.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Gaminara has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A non-Gaminara serovar, *S*. Welikade, clusters within serovar Gaminara. In the case of an infant infected with serovar Gaminara following exposure to a bearded dragon, the isolate was found to be [susceptible](https://journals.lww.com/infectdis/fulltext/2007/09000/salmonella_gaminara_osteomyelitis_and_septic.13.aspx) to ampicillin, cefotaxime, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Treatment was initiated with parenteral ceftriaxone.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Gaminara was found in [chicken](https://journals.lww.com/infectdis/fulltext/2007/09000/salmonella_gaminara_osteomyelitis_and_septic.13.aspx) and [bearded dragons](https://journals.lww.com/infectdis/fulltext/2007/09000/salmonella_gaminara_osteomyelitis_and_septic.13.aspx).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Gaminara has been mainly found in [the US and European countries such as the UK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Gaminara%22)).
