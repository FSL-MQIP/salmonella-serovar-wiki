Salmonella Alachua

## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica *(antigenic formula 35:z4,z23:=E2=80=93) is a serovar of the O:35 (O) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from swine in Florida, US, in [1952](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jb.66.1.118-118.1953).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Alachua has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. [The five outbreak strains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1413867015000288?via%3Dihub) exhibited nalidixic acid minimum inhibitory concentration values exceeding the threshold (=E2=89=A5256 =CE=BCg/mL) and demonstrated reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.5 =CE=BCg/mL).

## Animal Reservoir

: Serovar Alachua was mainly found in [chicken but was also present in pigs, and turkey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Alachua%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

**:** Although serovar Alachua has been reported[worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Alachua%22)), it is more frequently found in the countries such as the US, and UK.
