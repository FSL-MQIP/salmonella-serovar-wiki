# *S.* Bredeney


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Bredeney (antigenic formula 1,4,12,27:l,v:1,7) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. Serovar* *Bredeney is a rare serovar, in [the US](http://www.cdc.gov/nationalsurveillance/PDFs/NationalSalmSurveillOverview_508.pdf), 405 cases were reported in humans between 1999-2009; in addition, 11 isolates were obtained from turkeys in the US during the same period. In [Ireland](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.68.1.181-186.2002), a different trend was observed, as it was reported as the third most common serovar during the years 1998-2000.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Bredeney has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A non-Bredeney serovar,* S*. Give, clusters within serovar Bredeney. In the Netherlands one isolate of serovar* *Bredeney was reported to harbor an IncN plasmid carrying the [*qnr *genes](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/64/6/1332/742644?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) (quinolone resistance genes). Among [112 isolates collected in Ireland](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.68.1.181-186.2002), a high proportion (74%) of isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested, while 21% showed resistance to both sulfonamide and trimethoprim, and a single isolate (0.9%) exhibited resistance to multiple (five) antimicrobial agents.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar* *Bredeney appeared to be associated with poultry, at least in [Ireland](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.68.1.181-186.2002) it was associated with chicken; and in the [US with turkey](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/food/salmonella-serotypes-present-in-turkey-samples/). It was also unfrequently isolated from [cattle, and pigs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Bredeney%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 This serovar has been reported only in [North America, Australia, South Africa, Nigeria, and Europe](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Bredeney%22)).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

 Despite the fact that this is a rare serovar, multiple outbreaks have been reported. Below are a few examples.

^1^ *Salmonella* Bredeney and *Salmonella* Montevideo were both found.

^2^ *Salmonella* Bredeney and* Salmonella* Infantis were both found.

## Recalls

 Multiple recalls associated with serovar Bredeney have been reported. Here we selected one as an example.

| Year | Location | Recalled food | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2012 | US: multistate | [Peanut butter](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/salmonella/bredeney-09-12/index.html)^1^ | Nuts, nut products and seeds |

^1^ Trader Joe's Valencia Peanut Butter, manufactured by Sunland, Inc. of Portales, New Mexico, was the recalled product. This recall was caused by a multistate outbreak described above.
