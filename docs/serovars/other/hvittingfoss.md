## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Hvittingfoss (antigenic formula 16:b\:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:16 (I) serogroup. Found in [wild](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3833829)and domesticated reptiles and amphibians, and in [food-producing mammals](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087933), this is a rare serovar, though it has been linked to human foodborne outbreaks. [Infection with serovar Hvittingfoss](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00071-8/fulltext)can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and other related conditions. The first-ever reported case of acute gastroenteritis caused by serovar Hvittingfoss in India was described in a [case report](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11675239/).



## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Hvittingfoss has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Hvittingfoss isolates. [ST446](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00071-8/fulltext) was identified as the primary lineage among documented Hvittingfoss isolates in China. ST446 was also[the outbreak strain](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/salmonella-outbreak-sprouted-seeds-outbreak-assessment-march-2025_0.pdf) linked to consumption of sprouted seeds in Norway. [Fang et al.](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00071-8/fulltext) revealed the concurrent emergence of an outbreak-associated Hvittingfoss clone in regions of England. In Bar-tailed Godwits (*Limosa lapponica*) from Roebuck Bay in Northwestern Australia, all Hvittingfoss isolates collected were found to carry the [aminoglycoside resistance gene *aac(6')-Iaa*](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01312-20), a gene conserved across all *Salmonella* serovars but typically not expressed.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Hvittingfoss has been mainly recovered from [amphibians (both those raised as pets and for food items) and reptiles](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zph.12286).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Hvittingfoss has been reported [worldwide such in Australia, Europe and the US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).

1 This recall was related to the prolonged cross-border multi-serovar *Salmonella *outbreak linked to consumption of sprouted seed described above.

 The Northern Territory based company "Red Dirt" issued a trade level recall. This recall was caused by the outbreak described above.
