## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Hvittingfoss (antigenic formula 16:​b:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:16 (I) serogroup. Found in [wild ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3833829)and domesticated reptiles and amphibians, and in [food-producing mammals](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087933), this is a rare serovar, though it has been linked to human foodborne outbreaks. [Infection with serovar Hvittingfoss ](<https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00071-8/fulltext>)can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, and other related conditions. The first-ever reported case of acute gastroenteritis caused by serovar Hvittingfoss in India was described in a [case report](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11675239/).


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Hvittingfoss has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Hvittingfoss isolates. [ST446](<https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00071-8/fulltext>) was identified as the primary lineage among documented Hvittingfoss isolates in China. ST446 was also[ the outbreak strain](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/salmonella-outbreak-sprouted-seeds-outbreak-assessment-march-2025_0.pdf) linked to consumption of sprouted seeds in Norway. [Fang et al.](<https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(22)00071-8/fulltext>) revealed the concurrent emergence of an outbreak-associated Hvittingfoss clone in regions of England. In Bar-tailed Godwits (*Limosa lapponica*) from Roebuck Bay in Northwestern Australia, all Hvittingfoss isolates collected were found to carry the [aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6’)-Iaa](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01312-20), a gene conserved across all *Salmonella* serovars but typically not expressed.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Hvittingfoss has been mainly recovered from [amphibians (both those raised as pets and for food items) and reptiles](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zph.12286).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Hvittingfoss has been reported [worldwide such in Australia, Europe and the US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Hvittingfoss%22)>).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> Multiple serovars were involved in this prolonged outbreak. Here, the case number is only associated with infection by the serovar Hvittingfoss.

<sup>2</sup> Travel-associated


## Recalls

1 This recall was related to the prolonged cross-border multi-serovar *Salmonella *outbreak linked to consumption of sprouted seed described above.

<sup>2</sup> The Northern Territory based company “Red Dirt” issued a trade level recall. This recall was caused by the outbreak described above.
