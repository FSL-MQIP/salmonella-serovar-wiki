## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Cerro (antigenic formula 6,14,18:z4,z23:1,5) is a serovar of the O:18 (K) serogroup. This serovar [emerged in cattle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3095722/) in the United States. According to the CDC report of 2011, this serovar ranked [third](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotype-reports.html) among clinical-nonhuman sources. Hardly reported in human salmonellosis cases, but highly reported among [dairy cattle](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187753/).



## Genetic Characteristics

 [Subtyping by pulsed field gel electrophoresis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3095722/) (PFGE) had identified a single predominant PFGE type on dairy farms in New York and Pennsylvania. [Cohn et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9748477/) identified a large clonal clade comprised of predominantly sequence type 367 cattle and environmental isolates. Hypothetically disrupted coding sequences showed clade-specific losses of intact *speC* and* sopA* virulence genes in the large clonal *S.* Cerro clade, whereas the loss of intact *vgrG, araH*, and *vapC* was observed in all section Typhi *S.* Cerro isolates. [Cummings et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20187753/) studied Cerro isolates collected in New York dairy herds and revealed that resistance patterns varied from zero to nine drugs, and drug-resistant isolates were found on eight (40%) of the farms that tested positive for serovar Cerro. Serovar Cerro was found to be [polyphyletic with five phylogenetic groups](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Cerro isolates.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Cerro is known as one of the [cattle-adapted](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9748477/) serotypes; however, at least one of its clades has been shown to be [swine-associated](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Cerro has been reported [worldwide](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2019.00102/full) but[mainly in the U.S.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/) bovine samples). In addition, in [Southern Italy](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/esm.05.07.00028-en), this serovar was described as endemic in the year 2000.

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

 Multiple outbreaks of human salmonellosis due to serovar Cerro have been reported. Below are a few examples.

| Year | Location | Associated source | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | US: Multi-state | [Backyard poultry](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/backyardpoultry-05-24/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-24/index.html) | 470 |
| 2012 | US: Arkansas | [Eggs, chicken salad, person-to-person](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6308a2.htm) | 6 |
| 1985 | US: New Mexico | [Beef jerky](https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000628.htm) | 29 |

 Multiple serovars, including *Salmonella* Altona, Cerro, Enteritidis, Indiana, Infantis, Johannesburg, Mbandaka, and Typhimurium, were linked to this outbreak. The case number represents the total number of cases associated with the outbreak and does not specifically indicate the number of people infected by *Salmonella* Cerro.

<sup>2</sup> The total case count was n=597, and a total of 60 and 106 *Salmonella* isolates were cultured from 56 (Prison A) and 99 patients (Prison B), respectively. *Salmonella* Cerro was isolated from 6 patients that were co-infected with other serovars, and 8 isolates were obtained from the egg samples.
