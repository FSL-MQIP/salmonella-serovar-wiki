# *S.* Inverness


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Inverness (antigenic formula: 38:k:1,6) is a serovar of the O:38 (P) serogroup. This serovar is relatively understudied, with limited information available. Serovar Inverness was previously isolated from [raw, shelled peanuts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X2208810X?via%3Dihub), [breeder farms](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02090-24?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), and [surface water in Southeastern United States](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.02063-14#T2).

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Inverness has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). Serovar Inverness isolated from free-living aquatic turtles was found to have [two separate PFGE clusters](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.674973/full), E and G. Most strains from the Suwannee River with serovar Inverness (8 out of 9) belonged to [genogroup 10](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2011/461321), which also contained a clinical Inverness strain. However, one Inverness isolate from the Suwannee River diverged into genogroup 5 and showed closer genetic similarity to strains with serovar Muenchen. A [UK study](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/6/514) revealed that Inverness strains had the highest number of intact (25) and incomplete (33) prophages, making them extreme prophage carriers among other serovars they analyzed. Additionally, *S.* Bovismorbificans, *S.* Enteritidis, *S.* Dublin, *S.* Inverness, and *S.* Choleraesuis were found to share DNA similarity with the *Salmonella* phage_ST64B. [Switt et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3401170/) identified a 48 kb phage (PhInv-1b) encoding a secreted effector protein and the pertussis-like toxin ArtAB in serovar Inverness. They also suggested that the possession of both the type IVb pilus operon (i.e., *pilQ*, *pilV*, and *rci) *and IncI1-IncFIB replicons may be conserved in the Inverness genome.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unclear, but based on the NCBI PD metadata, serovar Inverness was isolated from [dog, raccoon, horse, and frog (*Scaphiopus holbrookii*)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Inverness%22)). One study also isolated serovar Inverness from [turtle](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.674973/full).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Inverness has been only reported in [the US, and the UK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Inverness%22)).
