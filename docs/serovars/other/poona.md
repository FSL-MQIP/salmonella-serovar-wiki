## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Poona (antigenic formula 1,13,22:​z:1,6) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) serogroup.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Poona has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/abstract) as serovar Bristol clusters within this serovar. A study of *Salmonella *genomes from human salmonellosis cases in Ghana found a strain of serovar Poona that carried[ blaCTX-M-15, qnrB1, and other antimicrobial resistance genes](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01010).


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Poona has been found in turtles, and has been associated with salmonellosis outbreaks in [pet turtles](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-10-15/index.html).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Poona has been reported [worldwide.](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Poona%22)>)


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Several outbreaks have been associated with serovar Poona.

<sup>1</sup>France, Belgium, and Luxembourg

<sup>2</sup>Three outbreaks of serovar Poona linked to cantaloupe occurred in 2000-2002. This is the total case number for all three outbreaks.

Border Rejections: Numerous border rejections linked to *Salmonella *Poona have been reported. A majority of these border rejections were associated with black pepper and identified multiple *Salmonella *serovars including serovar Poona. A few examples are listed below:

<sup>1</sup>Both *Salmonella *Poona and Morehead were identified


## Recalls
