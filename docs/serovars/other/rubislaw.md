## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Rubislaw (antigenic formula 11:​r:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:11 (F) serogroup. Serovar Rubislaw was [first described in 1934](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022172400027698)from a case report of human infection. This serovar has been frequently isolated from [farm](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-023-03121-3) and natural environmental reservoirs, including [water](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128937). *S.* Rubislaw has also been isolated from several types of fresh produce, including [papaya](https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.000895), as well as spices such as ground black pepper.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Rubislaw has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. Serovar Rubislaw is typically not associated with multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical infections in humans. However, [in a survey of equine clinical isolates submitted to veterinary hospital in the Southern U.S.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/aem.02829-17), 4 out of 12 *S.* Rubislaw isolates examined in the study showed phenotypic resistance to several antibiotics routinely surveilled by the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), including ampicillin, cetiofur, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, sulfisoxazole, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

## Animal Reservoir

*S.* Rubislaw has been isolated from various non-clinical non-human zoonotic reservoirs including [reptiles](https://doi.org/10.5694/j.1326-5377.2010.tb03743.x), [amphibians](https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12018), and [birds](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164402). Several human clinical infections of S. Rubislaw have been associated with contact with reptiles, including a human infection of *S.* Rubislaw in the U.S. that was linked to contact with [iguanas](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00037004.htm).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Rubislaw is widely distributed and has been found [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Rubislaw%22)>).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

There have been no reported outbreaks linked to *S.* Rubislaw.

## Border Rejections

Numerous border rejections associated with black pepper exported from Brazil were issued by Germany during 2020-2021. Some examples are list below:

| Year | Exporting Country | Importing Country | Associated source | Product category |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2021 | Brazil | Germany | [Black pepper](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/482948) | Herbs and spices |
| 2020 | Brazil | Germany | [Black pepper](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/426452) | Herbs and spices |

## Recalls

There have been no recent recalls linked to this serovar.
