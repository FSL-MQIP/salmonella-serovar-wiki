## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Umbilo (antigenic formula 28:z<sub>10</sub>:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:28 (M) serogroup. Serovar Umbilo is typically rare, with the [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/surveillance-atlas-infectious-diseases) recording 20 to 32 cases annually in the European Union/European Economic Area (including the United Kingdom until 2019) over the past decade (2014−2023). Public Health England found this serovar in [curry leaves](https://www.eurlsalmonella.eu/sites/default/files/2019-06/4%20Marie%20Salmonella%20contamination%20of%20%28imported%29fresh%20edible%20leaves%20190528_0.pdf). In 2001, serovar Umbilo was found in [ organic rocket salad and pre-packaged ready-to-eat salads ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X2203071X?via%3Dihub)from an Italian producer in the UK, though it was not associated with any human infections.


## Genetic Characteristics

Through investigating the ongoing Umbilo outbreak which was described below, [Rosner et al.](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2024.29.46.2400728) found that clinical isolates from Denmark, Germany, and Austria were genetically similar, with a maximum pairwise distance of 4 allelic difference (AD) and a maximum distance of 2 AD from the reference sequence. Umbilo isolates that had a difference of more than 5 AD from the reference strain of the outbreak were not associated with the outbreak.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Umbilo was found in [sheep](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6838269/), [field lizards](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X2203071X?via%3Dihub), and [badgers](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9738870/).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Umbilo has been reported in [Turkey](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6838269/), [the US](https://www.cdc.gov/nationalsurveillance/pdfs/2016-Salmonella-report-508.pdf), [South Africa, Kenya](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Umbilo%22)>) and[ Europe ](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/712437)such as Denmark, Austria, Croatia, and Germany.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup>158 cases of serovar Umbilo have been reported across 3 EU/EEA countries. The cases were distributed as follows: Germany (117), Denmark (22), and Austria (19). Through EpiPulse, six other European countries each reported between one and 20 cases of serovar Umbilo.


## Recalls

There have been no recent recalls linked to this serovar.
