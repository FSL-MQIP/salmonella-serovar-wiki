## Background Information

*Salmonella* *enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Kedougou (antigenic formula 1,13,23:​i:l,w) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) group. This serovar was frequently isolated (among top 10 serotypes) in [northern Thailand](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21034262/). A case of [bacterial enteritis](<https://www.jiac-j.com/article/S1341-321X(25)00021-2/fulltext>) caused by serovar Kedougou that developed after traveling to Thailand was reported. This serovar was also reported to cause [abortion in dairy cattle](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/10406387251324261). [In the UK, in 2023](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66e98539f8082e9740881c71/salmonella-animals-feed-gb-2023_FINAL__002_.pdf), reports of serovar Kedougou rose by 81.0%, making it the third most common serovar with 421 affected flocks—a substantial increase from 232 in 2022 and 192 in 2021. This serovar is linked to feed mill settings and can be found in ingredients like oilseed meals.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Kedougou has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Kedougou isolates. Among human-originated *Salmonella* Kedougou isolates collected in Thailand, [Pornruangwong et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21034262/) found that 84% showed resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes. In addition, three human stool samples contained strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins—two carrying *bla*(CTX-M-63) and one with *bla*(CMY-2). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) identified 45 distinct genetic clusters. Interestingly, human isolates from Thailand and the US shared identical PFGE patterns, indicating possible travel-related transmission. In contrast, most animal isolates from the UK formed separate clusters.

## Animal Reservoir

Unknown, but [chicken](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66e98539f8082e9740881c71/salmonella-animals-feed-gb-2023_FINAL__002_.pdf) might be a potential reservoir for serovar Kedougou. Based on the NCBI PD metadata, serovar Kedougou was rarely isolated from other animals such as [cattle and pigs](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Kedougou%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Although serovar Kedougou is rare, it has still been reported [worldwide occasionally such as in the United States and Thailand](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Kedougou%22)>).
