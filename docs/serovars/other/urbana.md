## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Urbana (antigenic formula 30:​b:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:30 (N) serogroup. Serovar Urbana has been reported to cause [encephalopathy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212148/) in a child in Japan.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Urbana has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A non-Urbana serovar, *S*. Johannesburg, clusters within serovar Urbana. [Saba et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24129620/) found that serovar Urbana isolated from humans in Africa was susceptible to the 20 antibiotics. [Three serovar Urbana isolates](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.000895#tab2) collected during a multistate outbreak in 2017 were found to carry *aph(3'')-lb*, *aph(6)-ld*, and *tet(C)*. The *aph(3'')-lb* gene produces an aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme conferring resistance to streptomycin and spectinomycin, while *aph(6)-ld* contributes to streptomycin resistance. The *tet(C)* gene is linked to tetracycline resistance. Additionally, the plasmid IncHI2 was present in all three serovar Urbana isolates.


## Animal Reservoir

Unknown, but according to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Urbana was isolated from [cattle, swine, and wild animals (lizards, central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps))](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Urbana%22)>).


## Geographical Distribution

According to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Urbana has been reported [occasionally worldwide but mainly in US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Urbana%22)>). The majority of serovar Urbana isolates originate from US (672 out of 817, accessed 06/03/25).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> Four *Salmonella* serovars including *Salmonella* Chester, Duisburg, Typhimurium, and Urbana were involved in this outbreak. The case number does not reflect the number of infections linked to *Salmonella* Urbana only.

<sup>2</sup> Among the infants infected, 57 developed gastrointestinal infections, 37 experienced diarrhea, and three had bacteremia.


## Border Rejections

There have been no recent border rejections linked to this serovar.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> The recall was caused by a multistate outbreak described above. On April 22, 2021, Jule’s Foods issued a recall of all their products, including their cashew brie.
