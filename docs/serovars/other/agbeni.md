## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Agbeni (antigenic formula 1,13,23:g,m,[s],[t]:-) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) serogroup. In [a US study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10793259/) focusing on multistate outbreaks of nontyphoidal *Salmonella* infections linked to animal contact (2015–2018), an outbreak of serovar Agbeni associated with turtle contact was found to have the highest proportion of isolates from blood (22%; 17/76).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Agbeni has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). Other non-Agbeni serovars, such as *S*. Limete and *S*. Ituri, group together within serovar Agbeni.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Agbeni was found in [cattle, horses, wild boar](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Agbeni%22)>), and [dogs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zph.13174).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Agbeni has been reported in [the US, Canada, Europe such as the UK, Ireland, and Norway](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Agbeni%22)>).
