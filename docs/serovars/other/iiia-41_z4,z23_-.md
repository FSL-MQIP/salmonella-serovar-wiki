## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *arizonae* serovar 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- (antigenic formula 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:-) is a serovar of the O:41 (S) serogroup. *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *arizonae *is associated with [reptiles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0944501317304159). Interestingly, all *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *arizonae* serovars are [monophasic](https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf), retaining only a phase 1 H antigen. Although several papers describe *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *arizonae*, they do not provide sufficient information at the serovar level. For instance, [Mahajan et al](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC309002/#r5). reported a fatal case of *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *arizonae* gastroenteritis in an infant with microcephaly; however, they only mentioned the isolation of *S. enterica* subsp. *arizonae* without specifying the serovar. As a result, we cannot include this information in our Wiki. In the US, among non-subsp. *enterica* serovars, both [serovar IIIa 18:z4,z23:- and IIIa 41:z4,z23:- ](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/152398/cdc_152398_DS1.pdf)are most frequently linked to human illness, with each serovar contributing to 10–20 cases annually. A study focus on Occurrence and Distribution of Serotypes of the Arizona Subgroup of Salmonella Strains in the United States from 1967 to 1976 and among 12 IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- isolates, 6 are intestinal while the rest 6 are extraintestinal. A [study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jcm.23.6.1056-1064.1986) focusing on the occurrence and distribution of serotypes within the arizonae subgroup of *Salmonella* strains in the United States from 1967 to 1976 reported that, among 12 IIIa 41:z4,z23:- isolates they found, 6 were intestinal and the remaining 6 were extraintestinal.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- isolates. Similarly, another study also found that serovar IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- is [highly polyphyletic](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8208698/#R19), with five lineages identified across clades B and C. Additionally, one of these lineages is paraphyletic, with a single lineage of serovar IIIa 44:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- nested within it. Among the 15 genomes of serovar IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:-, seven distinct prophages were identified.


## Animal Reservoir

Unknown; however, based on host information from the NCBI PD metadata, serovar IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- has primarily been isolated from [dogs and wild animals, such as snakes and birds (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos)](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=IIIa%2041:z4,z23:-%22)>). Additionally, two isolates were collected from [chicken (n=1) and turkey (n=1)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8208698/#R19), respectively. In a [study of Salmonella obtained from reptiles in Canada](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid3110.241803), serovar IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- was the second most commonly isolated serovar (n = 2 out of 46 *Salmonella *positive samples)<sup>8</sup>.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar IIIa 41:z<sub>4</sub>,z<sub>23</sub>:- has been reported in [the US, Canada, and Europe including Germany, Ireland, and the UK](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=IIIa%2041:z4,z23:-%22)>).
