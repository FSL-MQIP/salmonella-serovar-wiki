## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *houtenae* serovar 50:z4,z23:- (antigenic formula: 50:z4,z23:-) is a serovar of the O:50 (Z) serogroup. This serovar is also known as serovar [IV Flint](https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf). Serovar 50:z4,z23: was first isolated from three cultures in [1964 in the US](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/ijsem/10.1099/0096266X-14-2-59): two were recovered from the stools of hospitalized male siblings, aged 10 and 27 months, both suffering from severe gastroenteritis at the time of isolation, and the third strain was isolated from a bird snake. This serovar was previously reported to cause systemic salmonellosis in a [Florida manatee (*Trichechus manatus latirostris*)](https://meridian.allenpress.com/jwd/article/53/4/930/194544/Fatal-Systemic-Salmonellosis-in-a-Florida-Manatee). More specifically, necropsy and histopathological analysis revealed a chronic systemic bacterial infection affecting the renal, respiratory, lymphatic, and skeletal systems. In the US, serovar IV 50:z4, z23:- was found frequently in [Florida](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.656827/full) but not nationally between 2017 – 2018.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar IV 50:z4,z23:- has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* IV 50:z4,z23:- isolates.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, but based on the NCBI PD metadata, this serovar was isolated from [cat, dog, cattle, manatee, kangaroo, bird, and lama](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).

## Geographical Distribution

 Based on the NCBI PD metadata, serovar IV 50:z4,z23:- has only been reported in [the US, Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, and Taiwan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).
