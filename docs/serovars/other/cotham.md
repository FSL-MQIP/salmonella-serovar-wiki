## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Cotham (antigenic formula 28:i:1,5) is a serovar of the O:28 (M) serogroup. Serovar Cotham is a very rare serovar; for example, this serovar was found to represent a very scarce percentage ([0.01%](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/salmonella/cotham-04-14/index.html)) of all salmonellosis cases in the US since the 1960s.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Cotham has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). The NARMS laboratory at the CDC has analyzed *Salmonella* Cotham isolates obtained from 12 individuals infected with [the 2014 outbreak strain](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/salmonella/cotham-04-14/index.html#:~:text=On%20January%2022%2C%202014%2C%20CDC,reporting%20exposure%20to%20pet%20reptiles). Among these, one isolate (8%) exhibited MDR, while the remaining 11 isolates (92%) were pansusceptible. The MDR isolate demonstrated resistance to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Additionally, it displayed intermediate susceptibility (neither fully resistant nor fully susceptible) to ciprofloxacin.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Cotham appears to be adapted to [reptiles](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10562597/)^5^.

## Geographical Distribution

 This serovar is very rare, it has been mainly reported in [Canada^5^](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid3110.241803), [the US, but has also been found in Australia, Taiwan, Gambia, Nigeria, and parts of Europe, such as the UK and Ireland.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Cotham%22))

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

 Currently only two outbreaks had been reported, which started in 2012, and 2024, respectively.
