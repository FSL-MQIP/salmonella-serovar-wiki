## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Cubana (antigenic formula 1,13,23:z<sub>29</sub>:–) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) serogroup. *Salmonella* Cubana was first isolated by Curbelo in Cuba from diseased baby chicks. This serovar is very rare. Serovar Cubana was also identified from environmental samples from a ready-to-eat granola and cereal production facility.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Cubana has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with six lineages identified and three stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Cubana isolates. Some studies have found the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes in serovar Cubana isolates. Resistance to β-Lactam antibiotics was identified in a serovar Cubana isolate from a clinical case in the U.S.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Cubana was mainly associated with poultry.

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Cubana has been found in the U.S., Canada, Cuba, and Sweden.
