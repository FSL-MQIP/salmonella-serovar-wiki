**Background Information:** *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Pomona (antigenic formula 28:y:1,7) is a serovar of the O:28 (M) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated [1941 from poultry](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a118994). In a study of *Salmonella *from pet animals in China, serovar Pomona was identified as being the [leading serovar identified in turtles (25%, 18/71)](https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03542-23).



## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Pomona has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/abstract) with two lineages identified. A study of *Salmonella *in pets found some multi-drug resistant isolates of serovar Pomona in [cats and turtles](https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.03542-23) and 6 isolates from turtles that contained extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. A study of clinical and environmental serovar Pomona genomes found that many of the environmental strains had genes for the [type 4 secretion system (T4SS)](https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2024.2336597)and identified genes associated with virulence factors such as fimbriae production and invasion regulation ([*invA*, *invB*, *inv**C*, *fimA, fimC, fimD,* and* fimF*](https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2024.2336597)) from clinical and environmental samples.

## Animal Reservoir

This serovar has been commonly found in [turtles](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.08.025) and other reptiles, including [alligators](https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985816677149).

**Geographic Distribution:** This serovar has been reported from countries worldwide, including [the US, the UK, Germany, China, Mexico, and Australia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).

This outbreak was linked to serovars Pomona, Stanley, and Poona. The case number represents the total number of cases associated with the outbreak and does not specifically indicate the number of people infected by *Salmonella *Pomona.

This outbreak was linked to serovars Pomona (3 cases) and Stanley (25 cases).

Multiple serovars were linked to a series of 8 outbreaks from 2011-2013 involving pet turtles. The other serovars linked to these outbreaks included Sandiego, Newport, Poona, I 4,[5],12:i\:-, and Typhimurium. The case number represents the total number of cases associated with the outbreak. Infection with *Salmonella* Pomona occurred during Outbreak 2 (23 people) and Outbreak 5 (120 people).
