## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Minnesota (antigenic formula 21:​b:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:21 (L) serogroup. Serovar Minnesota was first isolated in [1936 in a Minnesota turkey farm (US)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20475465/). A strikingly high prevalence (86.6%) of serovar Minnesota was detected across multiple poultry farms in [Brazil's Center-West region around 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119385906?via%3Dihub).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Minnesota has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10). [Mukhtar et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mra.00787-22) reported the draft genomes of two serovar Minnesota isolates (SA49317 and SA49319) obtained from chicken meat in Saudi Arabia belonging to ST 548 and carrying the colistin resistance gene *mcr*-1.1. [de Melo et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/10/5/581) analyzed 20 serovar Minnesota isolates and revealed that all isolates exhibited varying gene frequencies, with *avrA* (apoptosis), *sodC* (oxidative stress), and *invA* (invasion) present in 100% (20/20) of isolates, while *agfA* (adhesion), *lpfA* (biofilm potential), and *luxS* (quorum sensing) were detected in 95% (19/20), 75% (15/20), and 80% (16/20), respectively; none (0/20) formed biofilms at 4°C. By including a total of 107 worldwide serovar Minnesota whole genomes, [Kipper et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7694379/#B6-animals-10-02043) identified two poultry-associated lineages in Brazil: *S.* Minnesota Poultry Lineages I (SM-PLI) and II (SM-PLII). Their phylodynamic analysis revealed that SM-PLI emerged around 1915, while SM-PLII arose in 1971, with the latter showing a larger number of isolates and a recent population expansion (particularly from 2009–2012). Both lineages carried plasmids (IncA/C2 and ColRNA), antimicrobial resistance genes (*aph(3′)-Ia*, *bla<sub>CMY-2</sub>*, *qnrB19*, *sul2*, *tet(A)*), and a virulence cluster (including the yersiniabactin operon). [Huang et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00077-4) identified the emergence of four serovar Minnesota clones, three of which were genetically mixed with global strains. They claimed that these clones displayed enhanced antimicrobial resistance and virulence, driven primarily by the acquisition of multiple plasmids—especially IncC plasmids—harboring resistance (i.e., *tet(A), aadA*, and *sul*) and virulence genes (i.e., *ybt, irp*, and *fyu*). Notably, IncC plasmids showed genomic rearrangements, resulting in diverse configurations of resistance determinants.

## Animal Reservoir

[Chicken](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33167341/) is the reservoir for serovar Minnesota. This serovar was also isolated from [other animals such as cattle and pigs.](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Minnesota%22)>)

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Minnesota has been found [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Minnesota%22)>).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

There have been no recent human outbreaks linked to serovar Minnesota.
