## Background Information

*Salmonella **enterica* subsp. *enterica* serotype Havana (antigenic formula: 1,13,23:f,g,[s]:-) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) serogroup. Serovar Havana was first identified in [1937](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/68/2/125/899111) after being isolated from spinal fluid during a meningitis outbreak at a hospital in Havana, Cuba, which led to the deaths of 21 newborns.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Havana has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with seven lineages identified. The strain ([Havana ST1524](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882401024007216)) exhibited high virulence in the *Galleria mellonella* larvae infection model. Additionally, this strain was identified as carrying the mcr-9.1 gene, which, when cloned, confers a significant 16-fold increase in colistin resistance. The [outbreak strains](https://academic.oup.com/tropej/article-abstract/28/1/14/1661403?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) originating in pediatric wards of two hospitals in Shiraz, Iran demonstrated high resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, gentamicin, ampicillin, kanamycin, and cephalothin except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Among them, only 14 (32%) were susceptible to cephalothin, and 6 (14%) to gentamicin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 1.6 µg/mL and >3.1 µg/mL, respectively.


## Animal Reservoir

[Chicken](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26449943/#:~:text=Isolation%20and%20serotyping%20of%20Salmonella,and%20thereby%20prevent%20human%20infections.) might be a potential reservoir of serovar Havana. It has also been found in [sea lions, cattle, horses, and swine](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Havana%22)>).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Havana has been reported [worldwide but mainly in Europe and the US](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Havana%22)>).
