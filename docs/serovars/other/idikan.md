**Background information:** *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Idikan (antigenic formula 1,13,23:i\:1,5) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) serogroup. In South Africa, this serovar is [uncommonly associated](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282775671_Incidence_of_Nontyphoidal_Salmonella_in_Food-Producing_Animals_Animal_Feed_and_the_Associated_Environment_in_South_Africa_2012-2014) with human illness. Aside from animals described below, serovar Idikan was also found in [sesame-based products, pepper, and soybean products](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).



## Genetic Characteristics

 In a [foodborne outbreak in China](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37743279/), both *Salmonella Uganda* and *Salmonella Idikan* were isolated, forming two distinct and genetically separate lineages in the core genome SNP clustering tree. *Salmonella Uganda* isolates showed 0-14 SNPs, while *Salmonella Idikan* isolates exhibited 0-23 SNPs.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Idikan was prevalent in [cattle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/) but it was also found in other farm animals such as [chicken](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/), and [turkey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/). This serovar was isolated from seafood including [white clam](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/), and [wild squid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Idikan has been found in China,[Saudi Arabia, Israel](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/), South Africa, [Australia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/),[Americas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/) as the US, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, [Europe](https://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx?Dataset=27&HealthTopic=46&Indicator=885467&GeoResolution=2&TimeResolution=Year&StartTime=2006&EndTime=2022&CurrentTime=2008&Distribution=885109&DistributionRepresentation=B&TimeSeries=region&TimeSeriesRepresentation=T) such as Spain, Sweden, Denmark, and France.
