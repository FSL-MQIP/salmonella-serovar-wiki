## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Adelaide (antigenic formula 35:f,g:-) is a serovar of the O:35 (O) serogroup. Serovar Adelaide was[first isolated in 1943](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/icb.1943.23)from a fatal case of enteritis in a man in Adelaide, Australia.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Adelaide has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with six lineages identified and three stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Adelaide isolates. The [outer core structure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2284502/) of serovar Adelaide LPS seems to differ from that of serovar Typhimurium and other *Salmonella* strains.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Adelaide was found in [wild boar, bovine, and caprine](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Adelaide%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Adelaide has primarily been reported in [North America, including the US, Canada, and Mexico, but has also been found in Chile, Brazil, Australia, the UK](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Adelaide%22)>), and [Ethiopia](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/505138).
