# *S.* Choleraesuis

Salmonella Choleraesuis

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Choleraesuis has the antigenic formula 6,7:c:1,5 of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. Within *S. *Choleraesuis there are [two biovars](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC387403/)*, S. *Choleraesuis* var. *Kunzendorf and *S. *Choleraesuis var. Decatur. *S. *Choleraesuis is utilized as an [H2S negative QC strain](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/2021-08/MLG-4.11.pdf) in the USDA Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook, Chapter 4: Isolation and Identification of *Salmonella *from Meat, Poultry, Pasteurized Egg, Siluriformes (Fish) Products, Carcass and Environmental Sponges. *S*. Choleraesuis was one of the first types of *Salmonella *discovered. [Theobald Smith and Daniel Salmon](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2634653/) discovered *S.* Choleraesuis in 1885 while studying swine diseases. This serovar is highly host adapted to s[wine and causes swine paratyphoid](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC387403/). Pigs that have been infected can shed the organism for up to [12 weeks](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10610219/) resulting environmental contamination and spread of the disease among the herd. Human cases from this serovar in [the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotype-snapshots.html) are rare, but nearly half of infections are invasive and can be severe. While it is not one of the leading serovars associated with nontyphoidal salmonellosis (NTS), *S*. Choeraesuis is one of the top servors implicated in NTS fatalities. In the 1990s, *S*. Choleraesuis was one of the top 10 serovars isolated from human cases in[Taiwan](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-0240_article). Improvements in swine husbandry, including vaccination of pigs, has substantially reduced the occurrence of Choleraesuis in Taiwan. Outbreaks from consuming contaminated pork are rare.

The* in-silico* serotyping tool SeqSero2, which is used by NCBI PD, cannot differentiate between Salmonella Paratyphi C, Choleraesuis, or Typhisuis because there are also two other* *serovoars with the same antigenic formula as *S.* Choleraesuis: *S.* Paratyphi C*. * and* S. *Typhisuis. Additional markers are required to accurately determine the serotype of Choleraesuis. Differentiation is accomplished through biochemical analysis, see Table 1 below.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Choleraesuis has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified. The majority of *Salmonella *Choleraesuis strains linked to human infections, particularly in Asian countries, exhibit [MDR](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7692705/#:~:text=Choleraesuis%20strains%20that%20have%20caused,resistance%20genes%20within%20the%20bacterial). This resistance is often attributed to traditional mobile genetic elements, such as transposons and plasmids, as well as integrative elements. These elements facilitate the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes within the bacterial genome via gene cassettes through site-specific recombination. *Salmonella *Choleraesuis in pigs harbors a [50-kb virulence plasmid](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC387403/) including the *spv* operon. The *spv* operon is essential for the systemic phase of infection in certain hosts, with the virulence plasmid size being serotype-specific. The strains were cleared of a 50-kb virulence plasmid and exhibited significantly higher 50% lethal doses (LD50) in mice.

## Animal Reservoir

 [Swine](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Diseases+of+Swine%2C+11th+Edition-p-9781119350859) is the reservoir of this serovar.

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Choleraesuis has been reported [worldwide](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Salmonella%20in%20domestic%20animals&author=MP%20Stevens&author=JT%20Gray&publication_year=2013&). Although *Salmonella *Derby is rarely detected in human cases in [the](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6206682/#CR1)[United States and European regions](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6206682/#CR1), it is the main cause of salmonellosis in several Asian countries such as [Thailand and Taiwan](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6206682/#CR1).
