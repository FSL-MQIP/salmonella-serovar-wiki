# *S.* Mbandaka

Salmonella Mbandaka

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Mbandaka (antigenic formula 6,7,14:z10:e,n,z15) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated in [1948](https://www.aaem.pl/Fifteen-years-of-successful-spread-of-Salmonella-enterica-serovar-Mbandaka-clone-ST413-in-Poland-and-its-public-health-consequences,72405,0,2.html) from a human salmonellosis case in the Belgian Congo. Serovar Mbandaka was ranked among the[top 10](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3129) serovars responsible for human salmonellosis cases in Europe. This serovar was also among the [20 most](https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/5208629/PhD_Thesis_RSHE_281209%20(2)%2017x24.pdf) prevalent serovars associated with human cases in other countries, along with Israel, North America, Africa, and New Zealand. In a [Chinese pig farm](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2021.0018?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed), serovar Mbandaka (12.6%) ranked as the fourth most prevalent serovar identified. In [nine broiler slaughterhouses in Brazil](https://www.veterinariaitaliana.izs.it/index.php/VetIt/article/view/2434/1189), serovar Mbandaka (12.7%) was the third most frequent serovars isolated. This serovar was reported to cause [travel-associated sacroiliac osteomyelitis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2013/543147) in a healthy adolescent.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Mbandaka has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Mbandaka isolates. A [Canadian study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01923-22?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) using CRISPR-SeroSeq on Ontario poultry farms found that spacer reads could not distinguish between serovars Montevideo and Mbandaka. [Antony et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7653644/) included more than 400 serovar Mbandaka isolates in their study and found two major groups with no pattern identified based on host or geographical origin. Additionally, they reported that a uniform virulence gene profile in all serovar Mbandaka isolates. Their phenotypic analysis revealed a similar trend in adaptation to a low pH environment and cell invasion behavior using a representative set of isolates. Among 403 Mbandaka genomes, resistance to tetracycline (16.87%) was the most common, followed by aminoglycosides (13.89%), sulfonamide (8.4%), QAC (6.9%), trimethoprim (5.7%), and quinolone (3.47%). The tetracycline resistance gene *tet(B)* was the most common (10.66%), followed by the aminoglycoside resistance genes *aph(6)-Id* (8.93%) and *aph(3'')-Ib* (8.68%). [Hayward et al.](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-365) revealed that S*almonella* pathogenicity island 23 was found in several serovars, including *Salmonella* Agona, Dublin and Gallinarum, but it is absent in *Salmonella* Mbandaka. In Poland, serovar Mbandaka carrying the [*blaCTX-M-8* gene](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11435008/) located on IncI1 plasmid was isolated from a broiler farm. Some Mbandaka isolates exhibited resistance to multiple drugs. For instance, in a [Brazilian study](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/2/312), all 6 Mbandaka isolates carried *aac(6=E2=80=B2)-Iaa* (amikacin/tobramycin resistance), while *aadA1* (spectinomycin), *sul1* (sulfonamides), *dfrA* variants (trimethoprim), and *tetB* (tetracycline) were detected in 4=E2=80=935 of 6 isolates.

## Animal Reservoir

 [Chicken](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39807938/) is the main reservoir for serovar Mbandaka. This serovar was also isolated from [other animals (pigs, cattle, fish, wild birds, and canine)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Mbandaka%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Mbandaka has been reported [worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Mbandaka%22)).
