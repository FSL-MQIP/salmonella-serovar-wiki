# *S.* Braenderup

Salmonella Braenderup

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Braenderup (antigenic formula 6,7,14:e,h:e,n,z15) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. Serovar Braenderup is the [10^th^ most common serovar](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotype-reports.html) among human cases in the U.S. However, serovar Braenderup was found in low percentage (>1%) in animals in the U.S. One report identified that serovar Braenderup can penetrate the eggs of [turtles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2031443/).

NCBI PD link for serovar Braenderup: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Braenderup%22)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Braenderup%22))

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Braenderup has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). To subtype serovar Braenderup, a [phage typing scheme](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC547744/) was created in the U.K. Among Braenderup isolates, *[qnrB19](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.01706-24?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)* emerged as the predominant AMR gene. A genomic cluster of serovar Braenderup [ST22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38179625/), was identified by Danish authorities as melon-outbreak-associated.

## Animal Reservoir

 Potential reservoirs for serovar Braenderup are [cattle, chicken, pigs, horses, and turtles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Braenderup%22)). However, isolation from these sources are sporadic.

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Braenderup is [widely distributed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Braenderup%22)), countries with reports of this serovar included countries in North America (US and Canada), Latin America (Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela), Europe (Greece, Austria, UK), and Asia (China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan).
