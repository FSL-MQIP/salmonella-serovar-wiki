## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Mikawasima (antigenic formula 6,7,14:y:e,n,z15) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. Serovar Mikawasima was first isolated from[tortoises in 1967 in Turkey](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/5600522/). The first isolation of serovar Mikawasima within the EU/EEA was reported in 1976 as part of a large-scale investigation into [*Salmonella* prevalence in Dutch pigs](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/RRA-unusual-increase-salmonella-mikawasima-cases-in-EU-EEA-28-november-2013.pdf). Between 2007 and 2012, a total of 671 human serovar Mikawasima infections were reported to the European Surveillance System ([TESSy](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/european-surveillance-system-tessy)) by EU/EEA countries. Case numbers in Europe have shown a consistent rise [since 2009](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/RRA-unusual-increase-salmonella-mikawasima-cases-in-EU-EEA-28-november-2013.pdf). Serovar Mikawasima cases showed a [92.1% increase over 2018 levels and a 137.1% surge compared to 2017](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/SALM_AER_2019_Report_Final.pdf). In US, there are no reports of serovar Mikawasima in humans and animals in the last 10 years.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Mikawasima has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with three lineages identified. According to [Novak et al. (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38330414/), all the outbreak-related isolates (n=75) were resistant to ampicillin and gentamicin. Most isolates (98%) showed resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, third-generation cephalosporins (36% to ceftriaxone and 47% to ceftazidime) and 40% of the isolates exhibited extended-spectrum =CE=B2-lactamase production. In addition, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis revealed that three outbreak-related strains (ST2030) have the same resistance gene profile [*bla*TEM-1B, *aac(6')-Iaa, aac(6')-Im, *and *aph(2'')-Ib)*]. [Ferencak et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/5/408) identified persistence Mikawasima strain in the University Hospital of Split and found that all sequenced isolates belonged to ST2030 and carried aminoglycoside (e.g., *aac(6′)-Iaa*, and *aac(6′)-Im*) and ESBL resistance (e.g., *blaTEM-1B* and *blaSHV-2*) determinants, with 10% showing an MDR phenotype. Detected virulence genes (e.g., mig-14) associated with biofilm formation imply possible nosocomial adaptation.

[Edwards et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13889310/) found that serovar Mikawasima, in addition to its standard y and e,n,z15 phases, naturally expressed two extra H antigens—z47 and z50—previously observed in Arizonae-group serovars. These four antigens showed no serological relatedness but could interconvert through both induced and spontaneous phase variation.

## Animal Reservoir

 [Pigs and wild boars](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/RRA-unusual-increase-salmonella-mikawasima-cases-in-EU-EEA-28-november-2013.pdf) are the reservoirs for serovar Mikawasima. This serovar was also isolated from [turtle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3298264/).

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Mikawasima appears to be frequently found in [Europe](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/SALM_AER_2019_Report_Final.pdf) especially [Spain](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/media/en/publications/Publications/RRA-unusual-increase-salmonella-mikawasima-cases-in-EU-EEA-28-november-2013.pdf) but occasionally in other continents such as [Asia and North America](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Mikawasima%22)).
