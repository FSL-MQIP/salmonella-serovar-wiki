## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Virchow (antigenic formula 6,7,14:​r:1,2) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Virchow was first isolated from a patient with a typhoid-like illness in [1930](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02183778) by Kaufmann. This serovar has been reported to infect a infant that was [transmitted by the household dogs](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/62/7/62_7_767/_pdf). The ranking of serovar Virchow compared to other *Salmonella* serovars ranged from 4th to 8th place in [Switzerland](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3050727/). Annual incidence rates demonstrated minor change during this period, declining from 0.45 per 100,000 people in 2004 to 0.40 per 100,000 in 2009. Children under 5 years of age showed a [seven times higher](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3050727/) *Salmonella* Virchow infection rate compared to those above 5 years. In South-East Asia, Europe, and Oceania, serovar Virchow is consistently found within the [top 20](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2010.0787?doi=10.1089%2Ffpd.2010.0787) *Salmonella* serovars. Most often, serovar Virchow infection causes gastrointestinal illness, however, in [Israel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14620309#bib14) and [other countries including US](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/198/1/109/840110?redirectedFrom=fulltext), human infections occur infrequently but demonstrate a high propensity for invasive manifestations.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Virchow has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. [Weinberger et al.](<https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(14)62030-9/fulltext>) revealed that only 6% of serovar Virchow isolates in their study were sensitive to all ten antibiotics evaluated. Resistance patterns varied, with 34% resistant to one antibiotic, 54% resistant to one to three agents, and 40% resistant to four to six agents. Notably, a substantial proportion of isolates showed resistance to nalidixic acid (89%), streptomycin (56%), tetracycline (43%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (38%), and chloramphenicol (28%). However, none exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone. Similarly, a [Swiss](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3050727/) study found that 48 serovar Virchow isolates (32%) showed resistance to 1-3 antibiotics, with a higher proportion (54 isolates, 36%) displaying resistance to more than three drugs. Resistance patterns remained stable throughout the study period (2004-2009). Nalidixic acid resistance was prevalent (62%), strongly suggesting concurrent decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility. Ciprofloxacin showed intermediate resistance, and ESBL production was rare (2 isolates).

In an *[in-vivo study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4668861/#B15)*, after oral infection of 7-day-old chicks, *Salmonella* Virchow colonized both the gut and spleen. This infection triggered increased specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies, along with changes in leukocyte populations (CD3, CD4, CD8α, CD8β, MHC II, KuL01, γδ TCR positive cells) locally and systemically. Elevated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 and the chemokine CXCLi2 was also observed. While primary infection of *S*. Virchow provided limited systemic protection against re-infection with itself or *S*. Typhimurium, it failed to protect against cecal colonization.

[Wang et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8146543/#B18-pathogens-10-00536) used whole-genome sequencing and identified the emergence of monophasic *Salmonella* Virchow variant (serotype 6,7,14:​r:-). This phenotype resulted from replacement of the *fljAB* operon with a 4.8-kb *E. coli* cassette, abolishing phase-2 flagellar antigen expression. Compared to 16 published serovar Virchow genomes, these two isolates possess a unique CRISPR type (VCT12) and show closest genetic relatedness to serovar Virchow strains BCW_2814 (Denmark) and BCW_2815 (China). Additionally, acquisition of *Salmonella* Genomic Island 2 (SGI2) harboring an antimicrobial resistance gene cassette conferred multidrug resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole.

## Animal Reservoir

[Poultry](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4668861/) is the main reservoir for serovar Virchow.

## Geographical Distribution

According to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Virchow has been reported in [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Virchow%22)>). In [Scotland](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6867700/), serovar Virchow represented almost 25% of confirmed human salmonellosis cases, while in [England and Wales](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2235368/), it was the third most common *Salmonella* serotype in humans, comprising 6% of isolates. However, its prevalence has significantly decreased, now accounting for less than 2% of non-typhoidal *Salmonella* (NTS) cases in the [UK](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45161822). In [Australia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9812398/), especially Queensland, serovar Virchow has been endemic since the mid-1980s.
