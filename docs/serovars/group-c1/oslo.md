## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Oslo (antigenic formula 6,7,14:a:e,n,x) is a serovar of the serogroup O:7 (C1). In US, serovar Oslo was considered rare with about [25 cases](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm655051a3.htm) reported each year. Devi and Murray found that serovar Oslo was one of the [most common](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1818386/) *Salmonella* serotypes isolated from school children between 1981 to 1983 in South Kanara District, India.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Oslo has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. A MDR strain of serovar Oslo isolated from urine and stool specimens was reported by [McCarthy et al](https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-abstract/68/2/307/1771605?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false#no-access-message). [Kumar et al.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2008.0252) found that three out of eight isolates from tropical seafood in India were resistant to carbenicillin, while the remaining five were pan-susceptible. A [US study](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/58/6/1308/731367?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) identified one serovar Oslo isolate resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, ampicillin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol, which possessed a class 1 integron with a gene cassette array of *dfrA1*.

[Jazeela et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00203-021-02243-4#Sec2) characterized an auxotrophic mutant of serovar Oslo and revealed that the mutant strain demonstrated greater invasion potential compared to the wild-type, although its replication rate was slower in both cell lines. Like the wild-type, the mutant retained cytotoxic activity in *in vitro* assays. Additionally, infection with the mutant strain led to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (*TNF-=CE=B1*, *IL-1=CE=B2*) and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (*TGF-=CE=B2*, *IL-6*, *IL-10*) in the infected cell lines. Their further analysis found downregulation of most virulence genes from *Salmonella* pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (*SPI-1* and *SPI-2*) in the mutant under *in vitro* conditions, except for *invA*, which remained active in HeLa cells. Their findings suggested that the auxotrophic mutant exhibits favorable characteristics for potential antitumor applications, particularly due to its ability to upregulate tumor-inhibiting cytokine genes in *in vitro* studies.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, serovar Oslo was previously isolated from [seafood](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6930137/) and [monkey](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/58537/cdc_58537_DS1.pdf).

## Geographical Distribution

 According to the metadata from NCBI PD (accessed May 13, 2025), serovar Oslo has primarily been reported in [US and UK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Oslo%22)), with 441 and 269 isolates, respectively, out of 840 serovar Oslo isolates available on NCBI PD.
