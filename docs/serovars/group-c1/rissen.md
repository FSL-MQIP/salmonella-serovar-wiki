## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Rissen (antigenic formula 6,7,14:f,g:-) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. This serovar was first nomenclating by [Rohde & Tiedje](https://catalog.nlm.nih.gov/permalink/01NLM_INST/1o1phhn/alma99218683406676) during early 1960s. In Japan, [Kaneko](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kansenshogakuzasshi1970/69/11/69_11_1294/_article) reported the first isolate of *S*. Rissen from patients with sporadic diarrhea was found during the period from April 1985 to December 1994 in Yamanashi Prefecture. Recently, serovar Rissen is the 4th most common nontyphoidal *Salmonella* serovar isolated from human infections in[Thailand](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epdf/10.1089/fpd.2008.0245).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Rissen has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Rissen isolates. Serovar Rissen ST469 has been found worldwide, in countries such as [Thailand](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160519301485?via%3Dihub), [China](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-and-infection-microbiology/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2022.936649/full), and [Italy](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/9/1377). This sequence type is the most common ST for serovar Rissen. ST8877 has been isolated from a cracked table egg in [Sudan](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340923001233?via%3Dihub).

[Pornsukarom et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/zph.12144) reported that all Thai Rissen isolates in their study were multidrug-resistant and more than 90% were resistant to ampicillin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline and streptomycin. Conversely, half of the *Salmonella* Rissen isolates in the USA were pan-sensitive while some were resistant to only tetracycline. [Wang et al.](https://www.dovepress.com/antimicrobial-resistance-and-molecular-characterization-of-salmonella--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR) observed that *Salmonella* Rissen human isolates (anal swabs or feces) had the common resistance profile: ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline; resistance were conferred by *bla*<sub>TEM</sub>, *tetA*, and *sul3,* respectively. A study from[India](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epdf/10.1089/fpd.2008.0252)reported on multidrug-resistant *Salmonella* Rissen strains (resistant to nalidixic acid, sulfamethizole, and carbanicillin) isolated from seafood in Cochin, India. Moreover, [Spanish](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.16.1900200) *Salmonella* Rissen isolated from live mussels carried *mcr-1* gene and other antimicrobial resistance genes (*aac(6')-Iaa*, *aadA1*, *aadA2*, *bla*<sub>TEM-1B</sub>, *cmlA1*, *sul1*, *sul3*, *tet(A)*, and *dfrA1*).

## Animal Reservoir

Swine is the major animal reservoir of serovar Rissen, including the pork production chain. However, *Salmonella* Rissen can be also detected in seafoods.

## Geographical Distribution

Serotype Rissen has been reported especially in Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, China, Japan, and India, but it has also been found in Italy, France, Spain.

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Two outbreaks linked to *Salmonella* Rissen have been associated with food. Some examples are shown below.

| Year | Location | Associated source | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020 | France | [Fuet from Spain](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2020/10/authorities-act-against-spanish-firm-linked-to-salmonella-outbreak/) | 18 |
| 2008-2009 | US: multistate | [White pepper](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2010/08/how-salmonella-rissen-came-to-america/) | 87 |

## Border Rejections

Multiple border rejections associated with serovar Rissen have been reported. Here we selected five as examples.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | Denmark | Finland | [Rapeseed expellers](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/706351) | Feed materials |
| 2022 | Spain | Belgium | [Turkey processed animal protein](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/586640)<sup>1</sup> | Feed materials |
| 2022 | Ukraine | Germany | [Sunflower cake](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/580283) | Feed materials |
| 2020 | Spain | Switzerland | [Chorizo sausage](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/454356) | Meat and meat products (other than poultry) |
| 2020 | Belgium | Austria | [Dog feed](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/screen/notification/435573)<sup>2</sup> | Pet food |

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella* Rissen and Muenster were found.

<sup>2</sup> *Salmonella* Rissen and monophasic Typhimurium were found.

## Recalls

| Year | Location | Recalled food | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2020 | France | [Fuet](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2020/10/authorities-act-against-spanish-firm-linked-to-salmonella-outbreak/)<sup>1</sup> | Food |
| 2019 | US: multistate | [Pig ears](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/10/after-154-reported-cases-in-34-states-the-pig-ear-salmonella-outbreak-is-over/)<sup>2</sup> | Pet treats |

<sup>1</sup> This recall was caused by France to withdraw all fuet with all dates and bearing the mark ES-10.12147/B-CE carried out in various stores across France.

<sup>2</sup> This recall was caused by a multistate human outbreak linked to several *Salmonella* serovars, including Rissen, linked to pig ears treats for dogs.
