## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Ohio (antigenic formula 6,7,14:​b:1,w) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Ohio was first described in [rodents in Malaysia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6523172/). This serovar has been previously reported to cause [septic arthritis and bone abscess](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3416725/) in an immunocompetent patient. In Mexico, serovar Ohio was the[most prevalent](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18162140/) *Salmonella* serovar associated with 300 children diagnosed as positive for diarrhoea. This serovar was also isolated from [tropical seafood](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/epdf/10.1089/fpd.2008.0252) in India.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Ohio has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). [Szmolka et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11354295/) found serovar Ohio in 4.3% (4 out of 92) of rats collected from various locations in Hungary. Their analysis revealed that 76.4% (117 out of 153) of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes were shared across *Salmonella* Ohio, Infantis, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium, with no unique genes specific to serovar Ohio. Additionally, none of serovar Ohio isolates carried virulence or resistance plasmids. A cgMLST analysis showed that serovar Ohio strains from rats in Hungary were closely related to poultry-associated strains in Hungary and grouped with global serovar Ohio isolates from aquatic sources. [Agustín et al.](https://academic.oup.com/lambio/article/41/1/39/6703014?login=true) studied Salmonella from a pig slaughterhouse in Spain in 1993 and 2001. They found serovar Ohio exhibited multidrug resistance (MDR), with 81% of strains resistant to at least 10 antibiotics (i.e., resistance pattern: ACSSuT‐CB‐MZ‐K‐N‐SxT). Four strains were resistant to 11 antibiotics, and one strain showed resistance to 13 antibiotics.

## Animal Reservoir

[Chicken](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19043089/) and [pigs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15960750/) may be potential reservoirs for serovar Ohio. This serovar was also isolated from [other animals such as horses and wild ducks (*Anas platyrhynchos*)](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Ohio%22)>).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Ohio has been reported [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Ohio%22)>), but primarily in [the UK](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19043089/) and [US (Out of 1,386 serovar Ohio isolates, 998 (72.0%) were from US, according to NCBI PD (accessed May 12, 2025))](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Ohio%22)>).
