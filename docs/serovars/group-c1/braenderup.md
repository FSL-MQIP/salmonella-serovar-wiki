## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Braenderup (antigenic formula 6,7,14:e,h:e,n,z<sub>15</sub>) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Braenderup is the [10th most common serovar](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reportspubs/salmonella-atlas/serotype-reports.html) among human cases in the U.S. However, serovar Braenderup was found in low percentage (>1%) in animals in the U.S. One report identified that serovar Braenderup can penetrate the eggs of [turtles](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2031443/).


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Braenderup has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). To subtype serovar Braenderup, a [phage typing scheme](http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC547744/) was created in the U.K. Among Braenderup isolates, *[qnrB19](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.01706-24?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed)* emerged as the predominant AMR gene. A genomic cluster of serovar Braenderup [ST22](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38179625/), was identified by Danish authorities as melon-outbreak-associated.


## Animal Reservoir

Potential reservoirs for serovar Braenderup are [cattle, chicken, pigs, horses, and turtles](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Braenderup%22)>). However, isolation from these sources are sporadic.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Braenderup is [widely distributed](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Braenderup%22)>), countries with reports of this serovar included countries in North America (US and Canada), Latin America (Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela), Europe (Greece, Austria, UK), and Asia (China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Multiple outbreaks linked to serovar Braenderup have been reported; in most of these outbreaks, the associated food was produce. Below are some examples.


## Border Rejections

<sup>1</sup> Multiple serovars were found including: *Salmonella* Braenderup, Dreetown and Abaetetuba.

<sup>2</sup> Multiple serovars were found including: *Salmonella* Morehead, Javiana, Braenderup, Saintpaul, Kiambu and Minnesota.

<sup>3</sup> Multiple serovars were found including: *Salmonella* Albany, Gaminara, Poona, Braenderup und Madelia.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> This recall was caused by a multistate outbreak. Fresh Start Produce Sales Inc. of Delray, Florida, recalled their whole cucumbers.
