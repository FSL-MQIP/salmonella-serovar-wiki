## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Lubbock (antigenic formula 6,7:g,m,s:e,n,z<sub>15</sub>) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Lubbock was first isolated from subiliac lymph nodes from cattle at a commercial abattoir in [Texas, US in 2015](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/genomea.00215-15?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org) and was initially identified as serovar Montevideo. In cattle feedlots, [Amachawadi et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/genomea.00319-16?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org) found a *Salmonella* prevalence rate of 20–25% in liver abscess samples, where serotype Lubbock predominated. [Nickodem et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132121/) revealed that the prevalence of serovar Lubbock varied across sample types in feedlots (environmental: 11.0%; fecal: 14.6%; lymph node: 17.7%).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Lubbock has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10). Serovar Lubbock likely emerged through a recombination event involving the transfer of the *fliC* operon from [serovar Montevideo into an ancestor of serovar Mbandaka](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mra.01450-18?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org). The existence of at least two recombination events is supported by the recovery of two serovar Lubbock lineages-represented by isolates 10TTU468x and 11TTU1590-from the peripheral lymph nodes of healthy cattle. All 58 serovar Lubbock isolates obtained in a longitudinal study of the feedlot environment belong to [ST413](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10132121/).

## Animal Reservoir

[Cattle](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mra.01450-18?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org) is the reservoir for serovar Lubbock.
