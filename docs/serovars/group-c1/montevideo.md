## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Montevideo (antigenic formula 6,7,14:g,m,[p],s:[1,2,7]) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated in [Uruguay in 1936](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/495402) from an infant with chronic enterocolitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) routinely includes serovar Montevideo among its [top 20 Salmonella serotypes](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/152396/cdc_152396_DS1.pdf) associated with human infections, causing an average of 700 illnesses in US each year. While serovar Montevideo ranked as the predominant *Salmonella* serotype in North America, it was not among the top five most reported serotypes in [other continents](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2019.00102/full).


## Genetic Characteristics

Chen et al. found that serovar Montevideo is [polyphyletic](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24) with four clades identified. Within the largest clade, Montevideo A, the subclade Montevideo A-10 was cattle-associated, whereas Montevideo A-7 was associated with environmental sources (e.g., water, sediment). The cattle-associated Montevideo-A-10 lineage (emerged ~1905) contained two clonal subclades, Montevideo-A-10-I (29% of isolates, emerged ~1968) and Montevideo-A-10-II (13% of isolates, emerged ~1958), both showing increased cattle-associated prevalence over time. [Lalsiamthara and Lee](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46232) used serovar Montevideo and Typhimurium to infect chickens and rabbits. They revealed that infected birds showed no visible signs of illness, and histopathology revealed only mild damage to intestinal epithelium and splenic parenchyma despite consistent serovar Montevideo isolation from these tissues. *Salmonella* Montevideo was internalized by chicken peritoneal macrophages at rates comparable to *Salmonella* Typhimurium but demonstrated greater susceptibility to chicken serum complement than rabbit serum. In mock-infected layers, serovar Montevideo caused transient internal egg contamination at trace levels, persisting for one week post-inoculation, suggesting infection of *Salmonella* Montevideo in chickens is asymptomatic and sub-clinical.

[Nguyen et al.](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000202) also identified four clades for serovar Montevideo in their study. They found that clade I strains have up to two large integrated mobile genetic elements (MGEs), each approximately 30–60 kb in size. A phage attachment site, known to be targeted by the lambdoid prophage Gifsy-2—a factor linked to virulence in *Salmonella* Typhimurium LT2 (which inserts between *pepN* and *pcnB*)—was found to be occupied by different prophages in Montevideo clades I and III (SM F7-F9). A prophage similar to Gifsy-1, Gifsy-2, or SEN34 (SM F8-F9), carrying the virulence genes *gtgE* and *msgA *but missing *sodCI*, was detected in all clade III strains except ATCC BAA710. Additionally, all clade IV strains contained Fels-2-like and Salmon_vB_SosS_Oslo-like prophages (SM F5 and SM F6, respectively), though these were not exclusive to clade IV. Furthermore, Montevideo isolates from all four clades were found to carry *Salmonella *pathogenicity islands (SPIs) with similarities to SPI-1 through SPI-6.


## Animal Reservoir

[Cattle](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23566273/) and [chicken](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46232#:~:text=Abstract,poultry%20or%20poultry%20meat%20products.) are the reservoirs for serovar Montevideo.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Montevideo is [globally distributed](http://www.jbjc.org/en/article/doi/10.3784/j.issn.1003-9961.2014.12.022).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Numerous outbreaks in different countries have been linked to serovar Montevideo, nuts have been associated with several of these outbreaks. Below are some examples.

<sup>1</sup> There were a total of 11 people infected with the outbreak strains of *Salmonella* Montevideo (9 cases) and Senftenberg (2 cases) reported from nine states.

<sup>2</sup> *Salmonella *Montevideo (4 cases) and Mbandaka (12 cases) infections were reported from nine states.

<sup>3</sup> Eleven people were infected by *Salmonella* Senftenberg. These 11 cases were not included in the overall case count (272).


## Border Rejections

Multiple border rejections associated with serovar Montevideo have been reported. Below are some examples.

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella* Anatum, Brancaster and Montevideo were found.

<sup>2</sup> *Salmonella* Abony and Montevideo were found.

<sup>3</sup> *Salmonella* Bredeney and Montevideo were found.


## Recalls

Multiple recalls associated with serovar Montevideo have been reported. Below are some examples.

<sup>1</sup> Wonderful Pistachios of Lost Hills, California issued a voluntary recalled. The recalled pistachios, distributed under the Wonderful, Paramount Farms, and Trader Joe’s brands, were sold across the US as well as in Canada, Mexico, and Peru.
