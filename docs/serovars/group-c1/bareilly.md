**Background information:** *Salmonella enterica *subsp. *enterica *serovar Bareilly (antigenic formula 6,7,14:y:1,5) is a serovar of the O:7 (C1) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from a paratyphoid case in India in [1928](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19312701578). Serovar Bareilly has consistently ranked among the[top 20 most common serovars](http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/PDFs/salmonella-annual-report-2011-508c.pdf.)isolated from clinical salmonellosis cases in the United States.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Bareilly has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that doesn't cluster with any other *Salmonella* Bareilly isolates.** **[Park et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9643863/) analyzed a total of 31 Bareilly isolates from various food-borne outbreaks in South Korea between 2014 and 2018 and revealed two major groups (A and B) each with two subgroups (A1, A2/B1, B2). Their comparative biofilm formation assay found that A group strain GG-07 has lower biofilm formation activity than B group strain GG-21. All 31 isolates have high susceptibility to 17 tested antibiotics.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Bareilly has been found in [a wide range of hosts](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#taxgroup_name:(%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Bareilly%22))including cattle, sheep, chicken, pigs, and wild animals.

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar Bareilly has been reported [worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#taxgroup_name:(%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Bareilly%22)).
