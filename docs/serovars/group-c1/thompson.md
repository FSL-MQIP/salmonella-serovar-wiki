## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Thompson (antigenic formula 6,7,14:k:1,5) is part of Group O:7 (C1). The first isolation of serovar Thompson was reported by [Scott (1926)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20474899/) during a foodborne illness outbreak in Yorkshire, suspected to be linked to the consumption of rabbit and beef pie. Surveillance data indicate that serovar Thompson has remained one of the top ten Salmonella serovars causing diarrhea in both [China](https://onehealthadv.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s44280-023-00001-3) and [US](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/58450/cdc_58450_DS1.pdf) over the last ten years. [Zhang et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323645/) suggested that serovar Thompson can be transmitted between poultry farms and humans. Serovar Thompson has been found to form [biofilms on eggshells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713523004085), leading to potential contamination risks.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Thompson has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Thompson isolates. [Zhang et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323645/) revealed that all serovar Thompson strain in their study carried *aac(6′)-Iaa* and the polymyxin resistance gene *mcr-9*, though susceptibility to polymyxin B confirmed that *mcr-9* did not produce a resistant phenotype. Antimicrobial sensitivity testing against 18 antibiotics showed that serovar Thompson isolates were resistant to streptomycin (100%), ampicillin (35.7%), and doxycycline (14.3%). Additionally, all serovar Thompson isolates harbored well-characterized virulence genes, including those from *Salmonella* pathogenicity islands (SPI1-5), fimbriae (*fimA*), flagellar assembly (*bcfC*, *flhD*, *fliA*,* fliC*, *fljB*, *flgK*, *lpfC*), and other virulence factors (*iroN*, *pagC*, *cigR*). Pathogenicity was further confirmed through yolk sac inoculation in 1-day-old chicks, suggesting that clinical serovar Thompson strains are highly pathogenic to newborn chicks.

Another [Chinese study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.01018-24) analyzed 141 serovar Thompson ST26 isolates from diverse sources and found that 29 strains—25 from diarrhea patients and four from animal-derived foods—exhibited co-resistance to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and azithromycin (CIP<sup>R</sup>CTX<sup>R</sup>AZI<sup>R</sup>), key frontline antimicrobials for treating human *Salmonella* infections. The predominant mobile genetic element in these CIP<sup>R</sup>CTX<sup>R</sup>AZI<sup>R</sup> isolates was the IncC plasmid, which carried four resistance genes (*qnrS1*, *qepA4*, *bla<sub>CMY-2</sub>*, and *mph(A)*) conferring resistance to these priority antibiotics. Closely related IncC-harboring isolates (0–23 SNPs) suggested clonal dissemination across multiple Chinese provinces. Notably, the presence of CIP<sup>R</sup>CTX<sup>R</sup>AZI<sup>R</sup> strains in aquatic food products implied the potential role of aquaculture in driving the emergence and spread of high-risk antimicrobial resistance. [Sheng et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996925001000) stated that, in China, serovar Thompson is the dominant *Salmonella* serovar carrying the *mcr-9* gene. They found that chicken juice substantially increases the proportion of *mcr-9*-positive serovar Thompson transconjugants. The dissemination of *mcr-9* is primarily linked to the IncHI2-IncHI2A plasmid.


## Animal Reservoir

Unknown, [chicken](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323645/) may be the potential reservoir for serovar Thompson. According to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Thompson was isolated from [other animals such as cattle, horses, and turtles.](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Thompson%22)>)


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Thompson has been reported [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Thompson%22)>).


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

<sup>1</sup> The outbreak was associated with consumption of chicken purchased from an El Pollo Loco restaurant located in Barstow, California.

<sup>2</sup> The outbreak involved six serovars including *Salmonella* I 4,[5],12:​b:-, Heidelberg, Javiana, Okatie, Weltevreden, and Thompson. The case number here (n=199) represents the total cases in this outbreak, not just those infected with serovar Thompson.

<sup>3</sup> Across 23 states, 220 infections were linked to five *Salmonella* serovars involved in the outbreak—specifically *Salmonella* Thompson (144 cases), Kiambu (54 cases), Agona (12 cases), Gaminara (7 cases), and Senftenberg (3 cases).


## Border Rejections

There have been no recent border rejections linked to this serovar.


## Recalls

<sup>1</sup> This recall was caused by a multistate outbreak described above. On October 23, 2023, Gills Onions issued a recall of their fresh diced onion products.

<sup>2</sup> This recall was caused by a multistate outbreak described above. On October 8, 2021, Northeast Seafood Products, Inc. issued a recall of their multiple products.

<sup>3</sup> This recall was caused by a multistate outbreak described above. Five *Salmonella* serovars, *Salmonella* Thompson, Kiambu, Agona, Gaminara, and Senftenberg, were involved. Grande Produce, Agroson’s LLC, and Freshtex Produce, LLC issued recalls of their papayas.
