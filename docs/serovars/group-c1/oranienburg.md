## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Oranienburg (antigenic formula 6,7,14:m,t:[z<sub>57</sub>]) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. Serovar Oranienburg was first isolated from [a child with gastroenteritis](https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/jb.32.3.259-263.1936), a resident of a Children's Home in Oranienburg near Berlin, Germany in 1930. Serovar Oranienburg ranked as the [10th and 15th](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2010.0787?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) most *Salmonella* prevalent serovar in North and Latin America, respectively. In 2003, serovar Oranienburg was the [nineth](https://web.archive.org/web/20050520232026/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/phlisdata/salmtab/2003/SalmonellaTable1_2003.pdf) most common *Salmonella* serovar causing human salmonellosis. Serovar Oranienburg was reported to cause [haemorrhagic cystitis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5610707/) (urinary symptoms including haematuria and dysuria) in an immunocompetent young male in Australia. In Japan, this serovar was documented to be [bacteremia-related](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9846185/). [Cummings et al.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/vbz.2013.1467?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) suggested that transmission of serovar Oranienburg can be also nosocomial or on-farm transmission.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Oranienburg has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with ten lineages identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Oranienburg isolates. [Jure et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20464138/) obtained 60 serovar Oranienburg isolates from children suffering from gastroenteritis and/or extraintestinal complications in a pediatric hospital in Tucumán, Argentina. All isolates in this study showed resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime, cefepime, and aztreonam, while displaying partial susceptibility to ceftazidime. This resistance profile aligns with the typical resistance phenotype, CTX-M-type beta-lactamase-producing. [Aguirre-Sanchez et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09603123.2023.2191312) analyzed 53 serovar Oranienburg genomes from different environmental sources in Mexica and identified a dominant clonal group consisting of ST23 and three additional STs. These isolates exhibited a maximum genetic divergence of 202 SNPs. Virulence factors for host invasion and colonization—including *rpoS*, type 1 fimbriae, and the type III secretion system (T3SS)—were conserved across all isolates in their research.

Another [Mexican](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378111922007867) study included 66 Salmonella Oranienburg genomes, revealing three subclades. Despite their conserved genetic content, these subclades appear to employ different adaptation strategies for persistence. This study also identified nine antimicrobial resistance genes: *aac(6′)-Iy*, *H-NS*, *golS*, *marA*, *mdsABC*, *mdtK*, and *sdiA*, along with a *parC* mutation (p.T57S) conferring resistance. Additionally, virulence gene analysis identified 92 pathogenicity-related genes [e.g., *faeC* (adherence *E. coli*), *mig-14* (inducible macrophage), *mgtBC *(magnesium uptake), *iroBCN* (ABC transporter)], as well as SPI-1 to SPI-5 and centisomes 54 and 63 with more than 80% sequence identity.


## Animal Reservoir

[Chicken](https://militaryhealth.bmj.com/content/112/4/211) may be a potential reservoir for serovar Oranienburg. This serovar was also isolated from [other animals including bovine, equine, porcine, canine, and wild animals](https://www.eggindustrycenter.org/soranienburg#:~:text=Specific%20animal%20species%20that%20can,salad%20and%20most%20recently%20eggs.).


## Geographical Distribution

While Serovar Oranienburg has been reported [globally](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Oranienburg%22)>), it occurs most frequently in [North and Latin America](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21492021/).
