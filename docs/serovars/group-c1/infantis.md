## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Infantis (antigenic formula 6,7,14:​r:1,5) is a serovar of the O:7 (C<sub>1</sub>) serogroup. This serovar was first reported in [wild birds in Florida, USA in 1979](https://meridian.allenpress.com/jwd/article/15/2/235/118210/ANTIMICROBIAL-RESISTANT-Salmonella-spp-ISOLATED). Serovar Infantis was identified as the most common serovar in broiler flocks (45.6%) and broiler meat (50.6%) across [Europe](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7009540/). In human cases, serovar Infantis ranked as the [fourth most prevalent](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7009540/)serovar in non-typhoidal *Salmonella* (NTS) infections in Europe. Additionally, in[the United States](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/foodnetfast/), serovar Infantis was consistently among the top 10 serotypes responsible for reported human illnesses in 9 out of 10 years between 2010 and 2019, with the exception of 2012, when it ranked 11th. Since 2016, serovar Infantis has become one of the most frequently detected *Salmonella* serotypes originating from [poultry sources in the United States](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/science-data/data-sets-visualizations/microbiology/microbiological-testing-program-rte-meat-and-7).

## Genetic Characteristics

In European countries, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) strain of serovar Infantis was disseminated; this strain emerged from broilers in [Hungary](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22564450/) (Hungarian clone of serovar Infantis). Resistant pattern of this Hungarian clone included resistance to: nalidixic acid, streptomycin, sulphonamide, and tetracycline. In [Italy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21821397), an MDR strain of serovar Infantis that showed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamide, tetracycline, kanamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole emerged in 2005-06. Later, [Franco et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144802) identified the spread of a MDR, ESBL-producing (*bla<sub>CTX-M-1</sub>*) clone of serovar Infantis harboring a conjugative megaplasmid (pSEI~ 280-320 kb) in the Italian broiler chicken industry and throughout the food chain. [Aviv](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mbio.01395-16)demonstrated that, despite its substantial size, the pESI plasmid does not hinder metabolic activity in vitro and has recently become firmly established in the domestic Infantis population. Through a mouse model, they showed that pESI can be horizontally transferred to the gut microbiota, including to commensal *Escherichia coli* strains after Infantis infection. A [previous study](https://enviromicro-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12351) noted that MDR Infantis strains carrying the pESI plasmid exhibited a higher rate of adherence to and invasion of human epithelial cells compared to pESI-negative strains. In birds, [Drauch et al.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/22221751.2021.1951124?src=getftr&utm_source=sciencedirect_contenthosting&getft_integrator=sciencedirect_contenthosting) found that broilers infected with pESI-positive Infantis displayed greater virulence than those infected with pESI-negative strains.

The CDC has identified [REPJFX01](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/php/data-research/repjfx01.html) as a persistent, MDR strain of *Salmonella* Infantis (hereafter referred to as REP Strain) that has led to illnesses and outbreaks both in the US and worldwide. This strain was first documented in PulseNet in 2012. It has spread to individuals in the United States through contaminated chicken and has also been linked to exposures during international travel. The REP strain show resistance to multiple antimicrobials, including key first-line and alternative treatments such as ampicillin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Meanwhile, this strain exhibits relatively high genetic diversity, with isolates differing by up to 82 alleles from one another, as determined by cgMLST (core genome multilocus sequence typing). [Chen et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24) revealed that serovar Infantis is polyphyletic with two lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Infantis isolates. Infantis-A-1-3, a chicken-associated clade estimated to have emerged in 1933, includes a clonal sub-clade which emerged in 1990 and represents 32% of the isolates, with an increase in the proportion of isolates collected from chicken or chicken-related sources.

## Animal Reservoir

The main animal reservoir of serovar Infantis is [poultry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160523002131); however, at least one of Infantis clade is associated with [swine](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01913-24).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Infantis is distributed [globally and is a common serovar in a number of countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160523002131).
