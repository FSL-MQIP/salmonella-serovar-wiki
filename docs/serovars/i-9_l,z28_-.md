Salmonella I 9:l,z28:-

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar I 9:l,z28:- (antigenic formula: 1,9,12:l,z28:-) is a serovar of the O:9 (D1) serogroup. This serovar is extremely understudied, with limited information available. According to the [10th Annual PulseNet Update Meeting](https://www.aphl.org/conferences/proceedings/Documents/2006/10th-Annual-PulseNet/22_Fields_Salm_Sero.pdf), the CDC suggested that this serovar is likely a monophasic variant of serovar Javiana (antigenic formula: 1,9,12:l,z28:1,5). This is because serovar I 9:l,z28:- shares the same O and H1 antigens as serovar Javiana but does not express the H1 antigen, making it monophasic.
