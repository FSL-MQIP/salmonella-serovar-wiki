# *S.* Mississippi

Salmonella Mississippi

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Mississippi (antigenic formula 1,13,23:b:1,5) is a serovar of the O:13 (G) serogroup. This serovar was initially identified in [1943](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3181/00379727-54-14395) after being isolated from a food handler's stool sample in Mississippi, US. In the US, serovar Mississippi ranked as the [14th most prevalent serovar](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/152398/cdc_152398_DS1.pdf) in human clinical cases in 2016, whereas in Tasmania, it is the [second most common](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.02012-17), responsible for 37% of all nontyphoidal salmonellosis cases in the state. In Australia, exposure to [contaminated drinking water](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/9/18-1811_article) and [wildlife contact](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/salmonella-mississippi-infections-in-tasmania-the-role-of-native-australian-animals-and-untreated-drinking-water/195BDF776A0BCE5D88A798AB59C0D4F1) have been documented as transmission routes for serovar Mississippi infections, while in US, the infections are primarily linked to [animal contact](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7168582/). Chui et al. reported a case of [left renal abscess and gram-negative sepsis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214442022002091) associated with *Salmonella *Mississippi infection.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Mississippi has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with three lineages identified. Similarly, [den Bakker et al.](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-425) and [Miller et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27999166/) also suggested that serovar Mississippi was likely to be polyphyletic. [Cheng et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8550085/) phylogenetic analysis of 364 *S*. Mississippi isolates from Australia, the UK, and US revealed geographic clustering, with U.S. (subclade Ai) and Australian (subclade Aii) isolates forming distinct groups within clade A, while clade B predominated in the UK. Genetic divergence within clades was driven by mobile elements carrying virulence factors: clade A variations arose from prophage differences (i.e., Entero_mEp460, Gifsy-2, Salmon_118970_sal3, and Salmon_vB_SosS_Oslo), whereas clade B diversity stemmed from acquisition of a 47.1-kb integrative conjugative element (ICE). [Miller et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02109-16?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed#tab1) also found that, for serovar Mississippi isolates, genes encoding S-CDT (*Salmonella* cytolethal distending toxins) are clade associated. [Ford et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6711244/) analyzed a total of 62 serovar Mississippi isolates from Australia and no antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in these isolates, except for a single human isolate from Tasmania carrying *blaTEM-1*, which confers ampicillin resistance.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, but according to the metadata from NCBI PD, serovar Mississippi was isolated from [wild animals such as turtles, and birds (*Porphyrio hochstetteri*)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Mississippi%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 [Cheng et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8550085/) found that serovar Mississippi were endemic in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. According to the metadata from NCBI PD, this serovar has been reported in [other countries such as Chile and Bermuda](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Mississippi%22)).
