# *S.* Heidelberg

Salmonella Heidelberg

## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Heidelberg (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:r:1,2) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. *Salmonella* Heidelberg was first identified in [1933 in Heidelberg, Germany](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=J%20Bacteriol&title=About%20a%20new%20type%20of%20bacteria%20form%20the%20paratyphoid%20enteritis%20group&author=VH%20Habbs&publication_year=1933&pages=367-374&). It was later detected in [the United States for the first time in 1954](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1588278?casa_token=sTneApEGY84AAAAA%3AxCcrraoy6aPu-M6ejq3MtxjBB1MMgP_Z6YwUi4_cVoYN9dHewNuMwxG9EeHAe6ua_dq1zAdT8vyzdTrmZ47-5_6uPGQhzNzzMViPBHNg6yfUnNVpvw&seq=1). In the United States, *Salmonella* Heidelberg ranks as the [third most common](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18757574/) serotype found in retail meat and food animal isolates. It is also among the[top four serotypes](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aac.01333-10)isolated from blood samples. Notably, 12%=E2=80=9313% of *Salmonella* Heidelberg infections in [North America](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/1/09-0729_article) result in invasive disease, a rate significantly higher than the U.S. average of 7% for all *Salmonella* infections.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Heidelberg has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). Previously, a [phage typing scheme](http://jcm.asm.org/content/41/9/4279.full) was developed for serovar Heidelberg in Canada; this scheme recognizes 49 phage types. *S.* Heidelberg accounts for the [8.6% of ceftriaxone-resistant](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/pdf/heidelberg-508c.pdf) *Salmonella* isolated from humans in the U.S. [SARA33](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3790100/) is a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain. This strain was found, *in silico*, to contain a novel integron cassette; in addition, it was found to carry the following resistance genes: *aac*(*6=E2=80=B2*)*-ly*, *aadA5*, *aadB*, *aa*(*6=E2=80=B2*)*-33*, and *aadA1*, *sul1* and *sul2*, *blaOXA-2* and *blaTEM*, *tetD*. Resistance genes in *S.* Heidelberg have been identified in the chromosome (resistant islands) and in plasmids. Different incompatibility types (A/C, FIB, HI2) have been identified in the [plasmids](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251446) that carried resistance genes in *S.* Heidelberg. A [MDR *S.* Heidelberg strain](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html) (resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline) was found to cause a multistate outbreak linked to the Foster Farms brand chicken. [Etter et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01065-19) analyzed a total of nine Heidelberg isolates collected during the outbreak investigation and revealed that (i) six *Salmonella* Heidelberg isolates linked to the foodborne outbreak exhibited increased heat tolerance, (ii) one of these heat-tolerant isolates also demonstrated enhanced biofilm formation under stressful conditions, (iii) heat stress triggered higher expression of multidrug efflux and virulence genes in *Salmonella* Heidelberg, and (iv) the outbreak-related isolates appeared to be transcriptionally prepared to better withstand processing stresses and potentially to cause infection.

Phylogenetic and pan-genomic analyses that included two of the sequenced *S.* Heidelberg strains and other *Salmonella* serovars concluded that *S.* Heidelberg (i) belongs to clade A, according to [den Bakker et al. (2011)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/425) classification, (ii) appears to have a single evolutionary origin, and (iii) contains 74 [gene families](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175032/) unique to this serovar.

## Animal Reservoir

** **[Poultry](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1282832/pdf#:~:text=Salmonella%20enterica%20subspecies%20enterica%20serovar%20Heidelberg%20(Salmonella%20Heidelberg)%20is%20primarily,Clothier%20and%20Byrne%2C%202016).), including chickens and turkeys, are the main reservoirs for serovar Heidelberg. It has also been found in [other animals such as cattle, swine, and dogs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Heidelberg%22)).
