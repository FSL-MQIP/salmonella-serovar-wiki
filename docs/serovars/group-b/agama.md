## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Agama (antigenic formula 4,12:​i:1,6) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. [In 1956](https://www.nature.com/articles/179164b0), serovar Agama was identified as a new serotype of *Salmonella enterica*, isolated from the feces of the agama lizard (*Agama agama*) in Nigeria. The[ first travel-related case ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2738453/)of salmonellosis caused by serovar Agama involved a tourist who had visited Gabon in Central Africa. Serovar Agama has been reported to cause [neonatal meningitis and septicaemia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26255922/).


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Agama has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Agama isolates. In a Nigerian study, serovar Agama isolated from poultry farms exhibited resistance to [ampicillin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6556926/).


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Agama was found in[ lizards](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2738453/), [chicken](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6556926/), [cattle,](https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1136/vr.157.22.703?saml_referrer) [badgers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0007193517339969), and [pigs](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Agama%22)>).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Agama has been reported in [the US, Nigeria, and Europe such as the UK, and France](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Agama%22)>).
