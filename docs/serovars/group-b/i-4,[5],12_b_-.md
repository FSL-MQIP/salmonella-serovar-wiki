# *S.* I 4,[5],12:b:-


## Background Information

: *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar I 4,[5],12:b:- (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:b:-) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. This serovar is [monophasic](https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf) which doesn't express phase 2 flagellar antigen. Serovar I 4,[5],12:b:- might be the monophasic variant of serovar Paratyphi B, as they only differ in the H2 antigen. This serovar has been documented as a fluctuating serovar in [broiler flocks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113501003479?via%3Dihub) and has been identified in poultry slaughterhouses in [Spain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113596012904?via%3Dihub) and [Denmark](https://academic.oup.com/jambio/article-abstract/94/5/826/6722108?redirectedFrom=fulltext). It is also sporadically isolated from [human gastroenteritis cases](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134810002030?via%3Dihub).

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar I 4,[5],12:b:- has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with three lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* I 4,[5],12:b:- isolates. [Initial characterization](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002776) through multilocus sequence typing revealed that serovar I 4,[5],12:b:=E2=88=92 strains clustered into multiple eBurst groups. Some of these groups included the biphasic serovars Paratyphi B, Dublin, and Enteritidis. Similarly, [Toboldt et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3753948/#B4) found that serovar I 4,[5],12:b:=E2=88=92 is polyphyletic. Two sequence types (ST88 and ST127) were associated with serovar Paratyphi B (d-tartrate positive), while two single-locus variants of ST1583 were linked to serovar Abony. Additionally, one sequence type (ST1484) was associated with Mygdal, a recently identified and newly defined serovar. Both NARMS and whole genome sequencing analysis didn't identify any predicted antibiotic resistance in the [outbreak isolates](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/salmonella/kratom-02-18/index.html).

## Animal Reservoir

 [Chicken](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241693851_Population_Structure_of_Salmonella_enterica_Serovar_4512b-_Strains_and_Likely_Sources_of_Human_Infection) may be the primary reservoir of serovar I 4,[5],12:b:-; however, this serovar has also been isolated from [horses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=I%204:b:-%22)) in the past.

## Geographical Distribution

 Serovar I 4,[5],12:b:- has been report in [Australia, China, Ghana, Europe, and North America including the US and Canada](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=I%204:b:-%22)).
