## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Agona (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:f,g,s:[1,2]) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from cattle in Ghana in[1952](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13902866/). Serovar Agona is the 10th most common nontyphoidal *Salmonella* serotype isolated from human infections in [China](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/fpd.2010.0827?casa_token=r5_H4WYgMn0AAAAA%3A5MU6aDnk2JmPoDATaXDvLO7TXqqWkEc57PaWFHA6ef0LkN2mJecTbfXy73ZKQ06d-5LnTu3a6w) and is also among the top 20 most frequently reported *Salmonella* serotypes in [the United States](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00591-19#:~:text=Agona%20is%20ranked%20among%20the,and%20different%20animal%2Dbased%20foods).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Agona has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with one lineage identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Agona isolates. Comparative genomics of [73](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003471&representation=PDF) of the sequenced strains identified three lineages of serovar Agona that emerged approx. 90 years ago. Serovar Agona has an accessory genome of approx. 1.3 Mb; this accessory genome includes (i) multiple prophages (P2-like, Fels-like, Lambda-like), (ii) antibiotic resistance plasmids (e.g., IncI1 plasmids), (iii) genomic islands, (iv) transposons, and (v) chromosomal integrons. Phylogenetic and pan-genomic analyses that included one of the sequenced serovar Agona strains and other *Salmonella* serovars concluded that serovar Agona belongs to clade A, according to [den Bakker et al. (2011)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/425) classification and it contains 133 [gene families](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175032/) unique to this serovar. [Bartsch](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10686068/) reported the MDR isolate, 18-SA00377, isolated in Germany in 2018, harbored pSE18-SA00377-1 plasmid (295,499 bp) carrying 16 ARGs. [Song et al.](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2023.0117?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) analyzed 209 Agona isolates obtained from food-producing animals during 2010–2020 in South Korea and found that resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently observed MDR pattern (60.6%, 86/142) in isolates from chickens and ducks. Among the three sequence types (STs) detected-ST13, ST11, and ST292-ST13 was predominant. In a UK study, [Waters et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11556752/) identified an increase in SNP variation in 207 Agona isolates associated with acute and persistent infections potentially reflecting a population expansion after acute *S*. Agona infection.

## Animal Reservoir

[Multiple animal species](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739514/), including turkey, swine and cattle are reservoirs of serovar Agona.

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Agona has been reported [worldwide](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00591-19#:~:text=Agona%20is%20ranked%20among%20the,and%20different%20animal%2Dbased%20foods.) such as [the US, the UK, and China](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Agona%22)>).
