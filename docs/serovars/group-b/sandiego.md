## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Sandiego (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:e,h:e,n,z<sub>15</sub>) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. Serovar Sandiego oldest verified isolation was in [1929](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1699-0463.1940.tb01492.x) in Denmark. It was in the top 15 most commonly reported *Salmonella enterica* serovars related to [animal contact outbreaks](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/zph.12569) in the United States during 2009–2014. This serovar was also isolated from [turkey-processing plants](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/am.16.1.1-9.1968?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) in the USA in the 1960's. and [pig farm environment](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/10766290260469697?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed) in Brazil. Although there has been a limited number of research on *Salmonella* Sandiego, human infections caused by *Salmonella* Sandiego have been reported, such as a [post-traumatic chronic subdural haematoma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445383910800?via%3Dihub) in an alcoholic heavy drinker patient, and a [prevertebral neck abscess](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/12/7/e230881.long) in a type 2 diabetes mellitus patient.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Sandiego has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified. Few studies have examined serovar Sandiego, and none have investigated its genetics.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Sandiego has been found in small turtles and their environments, and also found in [turkey flocks](https://www.sva.se/media/hekl4vom/sva-rapport-16-surveillance-2009.pdf).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Sandiego has been found in the United States and Canada, and, reportedly, also in Uruguay, Denmark, and Brazil.

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Several outbreaks have been associated with *S.* Sandiego, mostly associated with small pet turtles. There was a report on an outbreak of food poisoning with approximately 200 cases in California in [1938](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1699-0463.1940.tb01492.x). Two isolates of *Salmonella* Sandiego were obtained from this outbreak.

## Border Rejections

Multiple border rejections associated with serovar Sandiego have been reported during August 2020 to December 2021 and they were all linked to black pepper imported from Brazil to Germany. Some border rejections were linked to multiple serotypes.

## Recalls

There have been no recent recalls linked to this serovar.

| Year | Location | Recalled food | Type |
