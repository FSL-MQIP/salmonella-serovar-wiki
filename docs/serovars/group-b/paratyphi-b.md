## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Paratyphi B (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:​b:1,2) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. The classification scheme of serovar Paratyphi B has [changed over time](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54418-4) since infections associated with this serovar were first reported in the late 1800s. Serovar Paratyphi B can be classified by its ability to ferment tartrate. Serovar Paratyphi B (tartrate negative) is [associated with paratyphoid fever](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/salmonella-paratyphi-infection-2019/) and infections with this serovar are not common in the US. Serovar Paratyphi B (tartrate positive), formerly serovar Java, is [associated with gastroenteritis](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/salmonella-paratyphi-infection-2019/) and can also be written as serovar Paratyphi B var. L(+) tartrate+. Serovar Paratyphi B has also been found in some animals such as [dogs](https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.13174) and in [pet fish tanks](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3291456/).


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Paratyphi B has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified. A [study of 568 isolates](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54418-4) found that antimicrobial resistance is fairly recent for this serovar and is mostly related to resistance to quinolones. Serovar Paratyphi B [ sequence type 28 ](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/19-1121_article)has been highly found in poultry from Europe and Latin America with resistance to beta-lactams and quinolones.


## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Paratyphi B is almost exclusively host restricted to humans and closely related anthropoids.


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Paratyphi B is [widely distributed](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Paratyphi%20B%22)>) and had been reported in North America (US, Canada, Mexico), South America (Brazil, Colombia), Europe (UK, France, Denmark), Africa (Nigeria, Zimbabwe), Asia (India, South Korea, Japan), and Australia.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Several outbreaks have been associated with *S.* Paratyphi B.
