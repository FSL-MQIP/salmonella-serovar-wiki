## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Reading (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:e,h:1,5) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. Serovar Reading was first isolated in 1916 from water in [Reading, England](<https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)29468-9>). It has been implicated in foodborne illness, as well as a [breast abscess](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/5/951.extract), and a case of [osteomyelitis](<http://www.cmnewsletter.com/article/0196-4399(93)90046-P/pdf>).

Genetic Characteristics: Chen et al. found that serovar Reading is[polyphyletic](https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01913-24)with three phylogenetic groups identified. A study of 988 isolates from the US described a [highly adapted turkey clade](https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00056-20) among the 3 phylogenetic clades identified. They further identified an emergent subclade within the turkey clade with isolates from 2016-2019 and a found a difference in [antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors](https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00056-20) gained from plasmids and phage-like sequences between the emergent and contemporary subclades. Multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates have been isolated from[turkey samples](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/national-antimicrobial-resistance-monitoring-system/2018-narms-update-integrated-report-summary) and [beef feedlots](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-14751-9) with resistance to 3<sup>rd</sup> generation cephalosporins as well as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracycline. MDR isolates were also identified during the [2018 US multistate outbreak](https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reading-07-18/index.html) associated with turkey products.

Animal reservoir: Poultry and swine are the implicated reservoirs for serovar Reading, and it has been the cause of death in [turkey poults](http://ps.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/171.full.pdf+html).

## Geographical Distribution

*S.* Reading has been reported from countries [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Reading%22)>) including the US, UK, and and Australia.
