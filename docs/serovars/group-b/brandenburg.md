## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Brandenburg (antigenic formula 4,[5],12:l,v:e,n,z<sub>15</sub>) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. Serovar Brandenburg was first reported [in 1930](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=001f7b72ccab906c02c94e2f0e66af76dbe9dfed) in Germany. Serovar Brandenburg was reported among [the 15<sup>th</sup> most common](https://www.emro.who.int/food-chemical-safety/food-infocus/food-infections-network.html) serovars in Europe. It is considered an occupational hazard, because farmers can acquire the disease by contact with infected animals. [In New Zealand, in 1996](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2870545/#:~:text=Brandenburg%20has%20become%20established%20as,protect%20farmers%20and%20their%20families), serovar Brandenburg emerged in the sheep population and caused a number of outbreaks.

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Brandenburg has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Brandenburg isolates. [Siepker et al.](<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9446288/#:~:text=Salmonella%20Brandenburg%20NGS%20analysis%20detected,trimethoprim%2C%20and%20florfenicol%20(Suppl.>) studied Brandenburg isolates from two separate late-term abortion outbreaks in Jersey heifers and found all isolates were of ST type 873 and carried typhoid toxin genes, along with various fimbrial gene clusters, type III secretion system genes, and several pathogenicity islands. Out of [37 Brandenburg isolates](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/60/6/1227/820109?redirectedFrom=fulltext) collected in Spain, 21 of them exhibited resistance to one or more unrelated drugs, with the most common resistances being to streptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin, chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, encoded by the genes *aadA1, tet(A) or tet(B), aphA1, catA1, blaTEM,* and *dfrA1-sul1-sul3*, respectively.

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Brandenburg was found in [different animal species](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00480169.2004.36387) (pigs, turkey, cattle, horse, deer and sheep). However, in New Zealand, it was predominantly found in [ruminants (sheep mostly)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2870545/#:~:text=Brandenburg%20has%20become%20established%20as,protect%20farmers%20and%20their%20families.).

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Brandenburg has been reported [worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Brandenburg%22)>).

## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Outbreaks have occurred in different countries since 1963. Below are a few examples.

| Year | Location | Associated source | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2008 | Italy | [Restaurant associated](https://www.jpmh.org/index.php/jpmh/article/download/240/221/) | Approx. 200 |
| 2001 | Japan | [Hospital associated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11754160/)<sup>1</sup> | - |
| 1992 | Switzerland | [Not clear, multiple foods and animals were found positive](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7989535/) | - |
| 1963 | England | [Pork products](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/49A6A27218F15F0678FB17FFA92ABAAA/S0950268898008887a.pdf/div-class-title-laboratory-investigation-and-comparison-of-span-class-italic-salmonella-span-brandenburg-cases-in-new-zealand-div.pdf) | - |

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella* Brandenburg and *Salmonella* Corvallis were both involved.

Animal outbreaks:

| Year | Location | Breed | Number of cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2011 | New Zealand | [Ewes](https://www.odt.co.nz/business/farming/salmonella-devastating-flocks-south)<sup>1</sup> | 100~180 |
| 1996 | New Zealand | [Cattle](https://www.topfarmers.co.nz/know-how/salmonella/salmonella-in-cattle/)<sup>2</sup> | NA |

<sup>1</sup> Brandenburg infection causes abortion in pregnant ewes and has killed approx. the half of infected ewes.

<sup>2</sup> Brandenburg infection causes late-term abortions, sickness, and death in cattle, typically occurring during the late dry period (late winter/early spring). In naïve herds, first-calving heifers appear to be the most affected, with up to 35% experiencing abortions. During outbreaks, mortality rates can vary, averaging around 5%.
