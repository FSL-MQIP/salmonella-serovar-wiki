## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:i:1,2) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. One variant named *Salmonella* Typhimurium [var.](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/51/1/180/771276?redirectedFrom=fulltext)[Copenhagen](https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/51/1/180/771276?redirectedFrom=fulltext), which lacks the factor 5 in the O antigen (1,4,12:i:1,2). The serotype [1,4,[5],12:i:–](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2008.0213?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), which lacks the second-phase H2 flagellar antigen, is a monophasic variant of *Salmonella* Typhimurium. This serovar was named Typhimurium because it produces [Typhi like symptoms in the murine (mouse) model](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/deliver/fulltext/micro/171/1/mic001521.pdf?itemId=/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.001521&mimeType=application/pdf#:~:text=xylose%20lysine%20deoxycholate.-,TAXONOMY,before%20the%20Kauffmann–White%20scheme.). In humans, it is frequently associated with [acute gastroenteritis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457901013752?via%3Dihub). *S.* Typhimurium has been used as model to understand the pathogenicity of *Salmonella. Salmonella *Typhimurium is the most extensively studied serovar for nontyphoidal salmonellosis and has emerged as the [primary model](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.01368/full) for nontyphoidal *Salmonella* research. The *S*. Typhimurium LT2 strain has been particularly well-characterized and remains widely used in research since the 1940s. Both *Salmonella* Typhimurium and Enteritidis dominate global human salmonellosis cases, despite regional differences in prevalence.

## Genetic Characteristics

*Salmonella* Typhimurium has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified. According to [den Bakker et al.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/425) (2011) classification, *Salmonella* Typhimurium belongs to clade A of *Salmonella enterica*. This serovar is classified according to the susceptibility to typing phages, in definite phage types (DT); one common DT [(DT104)](http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/1/7) has been found to have resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamide and tetracycline (ACSSuT resistance type). In England, two outbreaks caused by a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain (ASSuTTm resistant type) of *S.* Typhimurium [DT120](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/fpd.2013.1513#utm_source=ETOC&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=fpd) occurred in 2011. A [review paper](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/deliver/fulltext/micro/171/1/mic001521.pdf?itemId=/content/journal/micro/10.1099/mic.0.001521&mimeType=application/pdf) concluded that lineages of *S*. Typhimurium was associated with different sequence types (STs). While ST19 exhibits a broad host range and commonly causes gastroenteritis in humans, the host-restricted ST313 is predominantly associated with invasive bloodstream infections in sub-Saharan Africa. According to EnteroBase, ST19 accounts for 86% of available *S*. Typhimurium genomes, whereas ST313 represents only 7%. Epidemic ST19 strains encompass multiple phage types, including DT104 (mainly cattle), DT193/DT120 and U288 (primarily swine), DT8 (ducks/geese), and DT160 (wild birds). Recent advances in genomic classification have introduced a hierarchical clustering (HC) system for *Salmonella* based on single nucleotide variations (SNVs). At the serotype-defining level (HC900), most *S*. Typhimurium isolates cluster within HC900_2, with a minority assigned to HC900_6511 and HC900_6910.

Most of the strains of *S.* Typhimurium contain a plasmid of approx. 90 kb that carry virulence genes (*Salmonella* virulence plasmid [(SVP)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20146749)). Large resistant plasmids of approx. 200 kb that represented different incompatibility types (e.g., IncHI1), have also been identified in *S.* Typhimurium. Prophages and genomic islands are important genomic components of serovar Typhimurium; for example, *S.* Typhimurium str. [LT2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v413/n6858/full/413852a0.html) has four prophages (Fels-1, Fels-2, Gifsy-1, and Gifsy-2). Pathogenicity islands (SPIs) are found in all *S.* Typhimurium sequenced to date, this include SPIs-1 to 6, 9, 11 to 14, and 16; being SPI-14 specific to *S.* Typhimurium. In addition, some genomic islands are strain-specific; for example, *S.* Typhimurium MDR strain [ST1660/06](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23105062) has three strain-specific genomic islands that encode putative virulence and resistance genes. Genomic islands that encode antibiotic resistance appear to be a common feature of a number of *S.* Typhimurium MDR strains, these genomic islands include, e.g., *Salmonella* genomic island 1 (SGI1) described in *S.* Typhimurium DT104 and genomic island GI-DT12 in *S.* Typhimurium [T000240](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21098248). The latest genomic island (GI-DT12) contains antibiotic resistance genes (i.e., *bla(oxa-30), aadA1, qacE=CE=941, and sul1*, *cat,* and *tetA*) and virulence genes (i.e., the aerobactin iron-acquisition siderophore system (*lutA* and *lucABC*), and an iron transporter (*sitABCD*)). Similarly, another study found that all *S*. Typhimurium [ST313](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24129621/) isolates collected from Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo carried resistance genes, including *blaTEM1b*, *catA1*, *strA/B*, *sul1*, and *dfrA1*, along with the *aac(6')1aa* gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Congolese and Nigerian isolates—from both blood and stool—were closely related. Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis uncovered a unique virulence-associated fragment (ST313-TD) shared exclusively by *S*. Typhimurium ST313 and *S*. Dublin.

In Sub-Sahara regions of Africa, [invasive strains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023330) of *S.* Typhimurium emerged, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogeny of these invasive strains and strains from other regions, showed two lineages of invasive strains that clustered together. Okoro et al. estimated that these lineages emerged independently around 52 and 35 years ago, closely coinciding with the onset of the current HIV pandemic. The shift from lineage I to lineage II isolates may have been driven by clonal replacement, possibly influenced by chloramphenicol use in treating invasive NTS disease.

[Schultz et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.01166/full) revealed that infection with *S*. Typhimurium enhances susceptibility to intestinal inflammation in both DSS-treated and IL-10^=E2=88=92/=E2=88=92^ mice. This heightened vulnerability is linked to the bacterium's ability to persist in the liver and spleen, a process mediated by virulence factors secreted through the type III secretion system encoded by *Salmonella* Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI-2/T3SS-2). While vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine moderately reduced the susceptibility of IL-10^=E2=88=92/=E2=88=92^ mice to *S*. Typhimurium-induced intestinal inflammation, it failed to eliminate bacterial persistence in these tissues. [During 4 to 6 weeks of chronic infections of *S*. Typhimurium](https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12866-016-0646-2), one mouse harbored phenotypically distinct adapted clones in the spleen versus liver, demonstrating tissue-specific bacterial evolution. Meanwhile, three co-housed mice became intestinally colonized by an identical clone containing a conserved non-synonymous mutation in *kdgR* (a metabolic transcriptional regulator), strongly suggesting cross-mouse transmission. Phylogenetic tracking revealed this mutation emerged in an index mouse within 14 days post-infection before spreading to two cage-mates. Subsequent challenge experiments confirmed this *kdgR*-variant possesses superior intestinal colonization capacity compared to wild-type, providing direct evidence of adaptive evolution enhancing enteric fitness.

## Animal Reservoir

 Serovar Typhimurium is [host-generalists](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC127920/) that can colonize and cause diseases in multiple animal species, including but not limited to cattle, poultry, swine, wild animals, and insects.

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Typhimurium is [globally distributed](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/fpd.2010.0787?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). During the study period from 2001 to 2007, *Salmonella* Typhimurium were the second most prevalent *Salmonella* serovars isolated from human in most regions, except in North America and Oceania (Australia and New Zealand). In these two regions, *Salmonella* Typhimurium was the most frequently reported in humans. Among human *Salmonella* isolates, serovar Typhimurium accounted for 17.1% of cases (ranging from 15% in 2007 to 18.9% in 2001).
