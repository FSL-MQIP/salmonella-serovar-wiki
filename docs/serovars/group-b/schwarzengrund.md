## Background Information

*Salmonella* *enterica *subsp. *enterica *serovar Schwarzengrund (antigenic formula 1,4,12,27:d:1,7) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup.  *S*. Schwarzengrund is among the most common serovars in non-clinical non-human sources in the US. This serovar was first reported in North America in 1952 when it was isolated from [turkey poults](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.116.3024.669.a). A case report from Japan indicates that [pyogenic sacroiliitis](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-023-00496-y), a rare type of extraintestinal infection, has been reported for this serovar.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Schwarzengrund has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella *Schwarzengrund isolates. A study of antimicrobial resistance in global *Salmonella *isolates found that serovar Schwarzengrund was positively correlated with [fluoroquinolone resistance](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59758-3). In addition, fluoroquinolone resistant strains have been linked to [imported food](http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/10/18/jac.dkr414.full.pdf) in the US. Multidrug resistant (MDR) strains (e.g., resistant to dihydrostreptomycin, kanamycin, oxytetracycline, bicozamycin, trimethoprim, and sulfadimethoxine) have been linked to [broilers in Japan](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yoken/62/3/62_JJID.2009.198/_article). MDR *S*. Schwarzengrund was found to be [transmitted from chickens](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/5/06-1489_article.htm) to people in some countries in Asia. A serovar Schwarzengrund isolate was found to carry some [markers of the plasmid to Emergent Salmonella Infantis (pESI)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2022.104112).


## Animal Reservoir

Poultry is the [main reservoir](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1305.061489) of *S.* Schwarzengrund. This serovar has also been found in [dogs](https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.13174).


## Geographical Distribution

*S*. Schwarzengrund is [widely distributed](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Schwarzengrund%22)>). This serovar has been reported to be prevalent in Asia and it has been found in Europe and the US as well.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Outbreaks associated with *S.* Schwarzengrund have been reported in the US; in addition, in Denmark cases have been linked to Thai food products.
