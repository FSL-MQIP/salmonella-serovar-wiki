## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Saintpaul (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:e,h:1,2) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. In [1940](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30092155?seq=2), serovar Saintpaul was first isolated from turkey in US. [Enter-Net surveillance data](https://web.archive.org/web/20090903064950/https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Pages/Surveillance_Reports.aspx) from European national reference centers revealed serovar Saintpaul as the fourth most prevalent *Salmonella* serovar (1.6%) in human isolates during Q4 2006, marking a notable increase in its role as a cause of human salmonellosis compared to previous years. Subsequent surveillance showed declining prevalence, with the serovar accounting for 1.2% and 0.6% of human *Salmonella* infections in Q1 2007 and Q1 2008, respectively. *Salmonella* Saintpaul was frequently listed as [top 20](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21492021/) *Salmonella* serovars in humans in Oceania and North America. A case of [testicular seminoma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37577346/) complicated by serovar Saintpaul-induced testicular abscess has been reported.

## Genetic Characteristics

 [Chen et al.](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msphere.00730-21) found that serovar Saintpaul appeared to be polyphyletic with four distinct phylogenetic groups identified. Within serovar Saintpaul, the comparative genomic analysis revealed 384 and 619 genes enriched in isolates from 5 human-associated (HA) and 4 non-human-associated (NHA) SNP clusters, respectively, that showed the strongest association with their isolation sources. This included five known HA-linked virulence genes located on Gifsy-1/Gifsy-2 prophages. Additionally, premature stop codons were more prevalent in 3 HA and 7 NHA genes. Cell culture experiments with representative strains from 4 HA and 3 NHA clusters found no increased invasion or intracellular survival capability in HA SNP clusters. However, the presence of *sodCI* (encoding a superoxide dismutase)—detected in 4 HA and 1 NHA clusters—correlated with enhanced survival in macrophage-like cells. In the study of worldwide population dynamics of serovar Saintpaul, [Panzenhagen et al.](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/16/3/254) found a total of 49 sequence types (STs), with ST-50 (787 genomes) and ST-27 (634 genomes) being the most common. All clinical isolates from South America, including PP_BR059 (isolated from a hospitalized patient in Cear=C3=A1, Brazil), belonged to ST-50. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) analysis indicated that 60% of *Salmonella* Saintpaul genomes had no resistance, while ST-27 contained the highest number of AMR strains. More specifically, among the 1,954 serovar Saintpaul isolates analyzed, 391 (20%) exhibited resistance genes associated with a multidrug-resistant phenotype. Additionally, seven isolates harbored the *mcr-1* gene, while 17 isolates carried the CTX-M gene. They also identified separate evolutionary lineages within ST-50 and ST-27. PP_BR059 showed reduced macrophage invasion (3.82%) but notably higher survival rates inside cells at both 2 hours (68.72%) and 20 hours (25.68%) post-infection. Similarly, serovar Saintpaul carrying both [*bla*CTX-M-2 and *mcr*-9.1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38423210/) isolated in chicken carcass was reported.

In [Germany](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20363784/), a clonal line of *Salmonella* Saintpaul with a multidrug resistant phenotype was found in turkeys and human feces. These isolates exhibited resistance (either complete or intermediate) to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, gentamicin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, spectinomycin, and sulfamethoxazole, along with intermediate resistance or reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and multiple third-generation cephalosporins (including ceftiofur and cefoxitin). Genotypic analysis revealed a conserved resistance pattern, featuring *blaTEM-1*, *aadB*, *aadA2*, *sul1*, and a Ser83=E2=86=92Glu83 mutation in the *gyrA* gene. Additionally, all isolates carried a chromosomal class 1 integron harboring the *aadB*-*aadA2* gene cassette. In an [Ethiopian study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30603680/), among all tested isolates (n=28), only 17.9% were pan-susceptible, while 82.1% exhibited resistance to one to three antimicrobials. All isolates remained susceptible to gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim. The highest resistance was observed against oxytetracycline (82.2%), followed by chloramphenicol, neomycin, and polymyxin B (3.6% each).

[Zwe and Yuk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32544260/) found that pre-treatment of serovar Saintpaul with ceftiofur resulted in enhanced phenotypic resistance to ceftriaxone. However, this exposure paradoxically reduced the bacterium's ability to transfer cephalosporin resistance via conjugative transfer of the *bla*CTX-M-65 gene.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, but [turkey](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2876473/) and [swine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8774669/) are likely to be reservoirs for serovar Saintpaul.

## Geographical Distribution

 This serovar is [globally](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11942379/) distributed. Serovar Saintpaul ranks among [the top ten most prevalent](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/index.html) non-typhoidal *Salmonella *(NTS)* *serovars globally, causing approximately 1.6% of severe human infections despite over 1,400 known NTS serovars. Between 2011 and 2020, serovar Saintpaul was one of the 10 most frequently isolated *Salmonella* serovars in [Brazil](https://www.clinicalcasereportsint.com/open-access/top-10-salmonella-serovars-associated-with-human-salmonellosis-in-brazil-2011-2020-8688.pdf), accounting for 1,222 cases (0.16% of 62,030 isolates). In the [Northern territory of Australia](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi4101k.htm), it was the third most frequently reported serovar in 2014, representing 11% of all reported salmonellosis cases.
