# *S.* Kiambu


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Kiambu (antigenic formula 1,4,12:z:1,5) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. Serovar Kiambu was found to be one of the most common *Salmonella* serovars in chicken in [Ontario, Canada](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01923-22). More specifically, an Canadian study revealed that serovar Kiambu was the most commonly identified serovar through[CRISPR-SeroSeq](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01923-22)and the third most frequently by culture in Ontario poultry farms. Interestingly, while previous studies on Ontario farms had rarely reported this serovar, these findings suggest that serovar Kiambu is an emerging but underreported serovar in Ontario's poultry production systems.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Kiambu has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full#h10) with one lineage identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Kiambu isolates. Two serovar Kiambu isolates were found to possess [genomic island SGI1](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jb.187.13.4401-4409.2005). SRC10 and SRC11 exhibited resistance to all antibiotics in the standard SGI1-containing DT104 set (Ap, Cm and Fl, Sm and Sp, Su, and Tc). These two isolates with two cassettes (*aadA2 *and *blaP1*) were additionally resistant to trimethoprim and also possessed *dfrA10 *and CR1.

## Animal Reservoir

The reservoir for serovar Kiambu remains unknown, but [chickens](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35617326/#:~:text=When%20present%2C%20concentrations%20of%20Salmonella,%2C%20and%20Michigan%20(12.1%25).)and [cattle](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002203022101078X) may be potential hosts. This serovar has also been isolated from [other animals, including cattle and pigs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Kiambu%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 This serovar has been reported [worldwide but is primarily found in North America, particularly in the US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Kiambu%22)). Out of 1,024 serovar Kiambu isolates available in the NCBI Pathogen Database (accessed April 10, 2025), 835 were from the US.
