## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica *serovar Chester (antigenic formula: 1,4,[5],12:e,h:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. In [1937](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5322187/#r16), this serovar was first isolated from humans during a food poisoning outbreak in the hospital of Chester, United Kingdom. Serovar Chester is a rare serovar worldwide. For example, in [Canada](https://web.archive.org/web/20120822142907/http://www.nml-lnm.gc.ca/NESP-PNSME/index-eng.htm), it only accounted for an average of seven human infections per year. In the US during 2001-2011, only 403 human cases have been reported. In addition, animal and food surveillance have not found serovar Chester in these sources in the US.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Chester has been found to be [ polyphyletic ](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full)with two lineages identified. [Multidrug resistance ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31099590/#:~:text=Among%20the%2033%20chicken%20isolates,;%20surveillance;%20whole%20genome%20sequencing.)was identified in two isolates of serovar Chester (ST2063), which harbored resistance determinants across five distinct classes of antibiotics. Whole genome sequencing of serovar Chester in Norway revealed[ four geographically distinct clusters](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6352000/). All isolates within the African cluster exhibited resistance to at least one class of antimicrobials, whereas resistance was uncommon in the other clusters.


## Animal Reservoir

There is not clear evidence of the animal reservoir for this serovar, although serovar Chester has been found in [various animals, including turkeys, cattle, reptiles, and birds](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362028X23014473#bb0010).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Chester have been reported[ worldwide](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Chester%22)>), including countries in North (US, Canada) and South America (Brazil), Morocco and Australia.


## Human/Animal Outbreaks

Despite the fact that this is a rare serovar, multiple outbreaks have been reported. Below are examples.


## Border Rejections

<sup>1</sup> *Salmonella* Vichow and *Salmonella *Chester were both found.
