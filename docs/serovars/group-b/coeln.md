## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Coeln (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:​y:1,2) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. This serovar is considered rare and is scarcely associated with human cases; only [32 human salmonellosis cases](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Coeln%22)>)have been associated with this serovar during the last 10 years in the US. Besides the animal reservoir described below, it has been isolated from [water of coastal rivers](http://aem.asm.org/content/66/4/1544.full) in the western Mediterranean cost. In Spain, serovar Coeln was associated with [one case of acute septic arthritis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38073261/).

## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Coeln has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with two lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* Coeln isolates. [An Italian study](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8065399/#:~:text=A%20total%20of%20164%20Salmonella,a%20matter%20of%20great%20concern.) revealed that one of the two Coeln isolates they analyzed exhibited resistance to antimicrobials (the specific class and number of drugs were not specified in the paper).

## Animal Reservoir

Serovar Coeln has been isolated in high frequency (21.8%) in [wild boars](http://www.actavetscand.com/content/55/1/42) in Italy.

## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Coeln has been mainly described in [Europe](https://food.ec.europa.eu/document/download/bdb7770b-f932-4038-951d-516d63c3690b_en) such as the UK, and Norway but has been also isolated in other [non-European countries](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Coeln%22)>) such as US, and Australia.
