## Background Information

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Derby (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:f,g:[1,2]) is a serovar of the O:4 (B) serogroup. This serovar was fist isolated from humans who were infected after eating contaminated pork pies in the UK in [1923](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3859161). It is one of the dominant* Salmonella* serovars isolated from slaughter pigs in [Europe](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/rn-206), and [ ranks #4 ](https://web.archive.org/web/20160514081524/http://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/pdfs/salmonella-annual-report-2012-508c.pdf)in the most frequently isolated Salmonella serovars from clinical non-human sources in the United States.


## Genetic Characteristics

Serovar Derby has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with seven lineages identified and two stand-alone singletons that do not cluster with any other *Salmonella *Derby isolates. [Berni et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10715017/) identified a widespread and rapidly expanding lineage within the global Salmonella Derby population that is predominantly found in swine but is notably rare in humans. This lineage carries stop mutations in the SPI-1 genes *sipA* and *hilC.* Their results suggested that serovar Derby does not require the ability to invade the swine intestinal epithelium to circulate among pigs, resulting in the degradation of SPI-1. This decay of SPI-1, in turn, leads to its reduced virulence and attenuation in humans. [Zheng et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713516304819#bib24) used CRISPRs typing and reported 35 new spacers in *Salmonella* Derby, with distinct spacer arrangements observed between ST40 and ST71 strains. [Luo et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1065672/full) found that two predominant sequence types (ST) of *Salmonella* Derby in China are ST40 and ST71, with ST40 currently being the most prevalent in Shenzhen. The phylogeny of serovar Derby are divided into five clades, and isolates from Shenzhen are primarily clustered in Clades 2, 4, and 5, showing closer genetic ties to strains from Asian countries (Thailand and Vietnam) than to those from Europe. Over an 11-year surveillance period in Shenzhen, Clades 2, 4, and 5 have emerged as the dominant epidemic branches, with Clades 2 and 5 exhibiting high levels of multidrug resistance. The most common resistance pattern observed is to ampicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

Animal reservoir: The most common reservoir for serovar Derby is [swine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10715017/). However, it has also been reported in [poultry, eggs and dairy products](<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Derby%22)>).


## Geographical Distribution

Serovar Derby has been reported [worldwide](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1065672/full) such as the US, Europe, and China.
