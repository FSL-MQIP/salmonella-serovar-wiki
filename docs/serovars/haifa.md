# *S.* Haifa


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Haifa (antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:z10:1,2) is a serovar of the group O:4 (B) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated from the feces of a 3-year-old Arabic child with enteritis in [1949 in Israel](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC385844/). It was linked to a case of fatal food intoxication in [Japan](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/yoken/58/3/58_JJID.2005.192/_article).

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Haifa has been found to be [monophyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). *Salmonella* Haifa isolates with [*bla*OXA-48-like](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/SALM_AER_2022_Report.pdf)was reported in Malta. [SGI1](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/204/5/675/799881) (*Salmonella* genomic island 1) variants have been identified in at least two additional *Salmonella* serotypes, Newport and Haifa, both isolated in Egypt. In an Egyptian study, a single Haifa isolate was identified as positive for the[*invA*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6702568/) gene.
