# *S.* Johannesburg


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Johannesburg (antigenic formula: 1,40:b:e,n,x) is a serovar of the O:40 (R) serogroup. This serovar was first isolated in[South Africa in 1952](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/full/10.5555/19532201465). In a [US study](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.07015-11), serovar Johannesburg remained the most frequently isolated serotypes of the 9 serotypes detected from chilled final carcasses in pork processing plants. This serovar was reported to cause [septic deep vein thrombosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016344530090762X?via%3Dihub).

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar Johannesburg has been found to be [paraphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full). A non-Johannesburg serovar, *S*. Urbana, clusters within serovar Johannesburg. [74.2%](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.07015-11) of Johannesburg isolates (out of 66) found in pork processing plants were MDR. [Class 1 integrons](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/12/4/669) were found in Johannesburg isolates. [Chau et al.](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/micro/10.1099/00221287-128-2-239) revealed that between 1973 and 1975, Johannesburg strains exhibiting the ASTCKSu-resistance pattern were most common, while those with the ASCKSu-resistance pattern became predominant from 1976 to 1979. These resistance traits were mediated by autotransferring plasmids of the incompatibility group FI me. The ASTCKSu-resistance plasmids were highly unstable, generating deletion variants at a significantly higher rate than ASCKSu-resistance plasmids—whether naturally occurring or derived in vitro from ASTCKSu-resistance plasmids suggesting that the ASCKSu-resistance plasmid could be a deletion variant of the ASTCKSu-resistance plasmid.

## Animal Reservoir

 Unknown, [chicken](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1320082/) tends to be a potential reservoir for serovar Johannesburg. Based on the NCBI PD metadata, this serovar was also isolated from [other animals such as pigs and cattle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Johannesburg%22)).

## Geographical Distribution

 This serovar was considered rare but has still been occasionally reported [worldwide, such as in the US, the UK, and South Africa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=Johannesburg%22)).
