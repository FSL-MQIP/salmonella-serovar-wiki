# *S.* IV 48:g,z51:-


## Background Information

 *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *houtenae* serovar 48:g,z51:- (antigenic formula: 48:g,z51:-) is a serovar of the O:48 (Y) serogroup. This serovar was also known as serovar[IV Marina](https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf). Serovar IV 48:g,z51:- was reported to cause [diarrhea in two infants](https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00015963.htm) in Indiana, US, in 1990, with iguanas (lizards) identified as the carrier. This serovar has been frequently linked to [reptile-associated salmonellosis](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/99/3/399/67501/Iguanas-and-Salmonella-Marina-Infection-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext). [One study](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/99/3/399/67501/Iguanas-and-Salmonella-Marina-Infection-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) pointed out that 26 (81%) of 32 patients infected by serovar IV Marina were infants in the US in 1994. Severe diseases such as [sepsis and bacteremia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14668712/) have also been reported in children.

## Genetic Characteristics

 Serovar IV:48:g,z51:- has been found to be [polyphyletic](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2025.1547190/full) with four lineages identified and one stand-alone singleton that does not cluster with any other *Salmonella* IV:48:g,z51:- isolates. IV:48:g,z51:- isolates showed [intermediate resistance to AmC, CTX, CAZ, and Te](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/zph.12093). The [CFSAN039533](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713482030157X?via%3Dihub) strain harbored multiple virulence genes associated with SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-3, SPI-5, and fimbriae. Despite carrying resistance genes linked to the aminoglycosides family, the strain displayed a susceptible phenotype. Genomic analysis and carbon source utilization assessment revealed that the strain possesses the ability to metabolize a wide range of compounds associated with central metabolic pathways.

## Animal Reservoir

 [Reptiles](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/99/3/399/67501/Iguanas-and-Salmonella-Marina-Infection-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) such as snakes and lizards are the main reservoirs for serovar IV:48:g,z51:-.

## Geographical Distribution

 Based on the NCBI PD metadata, serovar IV 48:g,z51:- has only been reported in [Europe, Brazil, and North America including the US, Canada, and Mexico](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/isolates/#(taxgroup_name:%22Salmonella%20enterica%22)%20AND%20computed_types:(%22serotype=IV%2048:g,z51:-%22)). A [West Indies study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/zph.12093)also isolated serovar IV 48:g,z51:- from wild and domestic green Iguanas (*Iguana iguana*).
