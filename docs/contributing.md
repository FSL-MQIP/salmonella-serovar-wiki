## Guidelines

!!! tip "Consistency matters"
    All serovar pages follow a standardized eight-section structure. See [Home](index.md#serovar-page-structure) for full section descriptions.

- **Cite all sources** using numbered hyperlinks
- For **outbreaks**, always include: year, location, source, and case count
- For **border rejections**, include: year, exporting country, enforcing country, source, and product category
- Use [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) archived links for any expired URLs
- Use *italics* for species names (e.g., `*Salmonella*`) and gene names (e.g., `*gyrA*`)
