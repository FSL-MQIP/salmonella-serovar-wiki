## About

*Salmonella* is a major foodborne pathogen causing substantial illness and economic burden globally. Non-typhoidal *Salmonella* (NTS) serovars are a leading cause of death and hospitalization related to foodborne diseases in the United States, accounting for an estimated 1.3 million illnesses, 12,500 hospitalizations, and 238 deaths every year [1].

The **Salmonella Serovar Wiki** fills a critical gap by providing a centralized, curated resource with comprehensive, serovar-specific information. It consolidates data from over a dozen authoritative sources, including peer-reviewed literature, surveillance reports, genomic databases, and regulatory agency publications.

=== "Public Health"

    Facilitates **hypothesis generation** during outbreak investigations. Epidemiologists can quickly identify historical outbreak patterns, common food vehicles, and geographical hotspots for a given serovar.

=== "Industry"

    Helps food industry professionals understand **contamination risks** posed by specific serovars. Supports traceback investigation and root cause analysis.

=== "Academia"

    Enables researchers to **rapidly retrieve** serovar-specific information, avoiding redundant literature searches. Highlights understudied serovars.
