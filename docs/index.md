A curated web portal providing comprehensive, serovar-specific information on more than 100 *Salmonella* serovars, including their geographical distribution, genomic characteristics, animal reservoirs, and outbreak history.

Developed and maintained by the [Cornell Food Safety Laboratory](https://foodsafety.cornell.edu/) (Wiedmann Lab).

## What You'll Find

Each serovar page includes up to eight sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Background Information** | Scientific name, antigenic formula, serogroup, initial identification, clinical symptoms, prevalence |
| **Genetic Characteristics** | Antimicrobial resistance patterns, virulence factors, phylogenetic information |
| **Animal Reservoir** | Known animal reservoirs and host associations |
| **Geographical Distribution** | Countries and regions where the serovar has been reported |
| **Human/Animal Outbreaks** | Year, location, source, and case count for documented outbreaks |
| **Border Rejections** | Exporting country, enforcing country, source, and product category |
