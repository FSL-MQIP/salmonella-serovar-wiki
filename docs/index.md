## About

*Salmonella* is a major foodborne pathogen worldwide, with more than 2,500 serovars identified. Despite this diversity, no centralized platform previously existed to collectively describe key serovar-level information. The **Salmonella Serovar Wiki** fills this gap.

=== "Public Health"

    Facilitates **hypothesis generation** during outbreak investigations. Epidemiologists can quickly identify historical outbreak patterns, common food vehicles, and geographical hotspots for a given serovar.

=== "Industry"

    Helps food industry professionals understand **contamination risks** posed by specific serovars. Supports traceback investigation and root cause analysis.

=== "Academia"

    Enables researchers to **rapidly retrieve** serovar-specific information, avoiding redundant literature searches. Highlights understudied serovars.

## At a Glance

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| **Serovars covered** | 111 |
| **Documented outbreaks** | 400+ |
| **Border rejections** | 150+ |
| **Product recalls** | 150+ |
| **Data sources** | 10+ authoritative databases |

## Serovar Page Structure

Each serovar page follows a standardized eight-section format:

| Section | What's Included |
|---------|-----------------|
| :material-information-outline: **Background** | Scientific name, antigenic formula, serogroup, first isolation, clinical symptoms, prevalence |
| :material-dna: **Genetic Characteristics** | AMR patterns, virulence factors, phylogenetic classification |
| :material-cow: **Animal Reservoir** | Known host associations and reservoir species |
| :material-earth: **Geographical Distribution** | Countries and regions where the serovar has been reported |
| :material-alert-circle-outline: **Human/Animal Outbreaks** | Year, location, source, case count |
| :material-shield-alert-outline: **Border Rejections** | Exporting/enforcing country, source, product category |
| :material-package-variant-closed: **Recalls** | Year, location, recalled product, type |
| :material-link-variant: **References** | Numbered citations to peer-reviewed literature and surveillance reports |
