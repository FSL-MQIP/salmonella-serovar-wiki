# About the Salmonella Serovar Wiki

The Salmonella Serovar Wiki was developed to address the lack of a centralized resource providing serovar-specific information on *Salmonella*. It consolidates data from authoritative public health and regulatory sources into a single, searchable platform.

## Purpose

- **Public Health:** Facilitate hypothesis generation and aid outbreak investigations
- **Industry:** Understand contamination risks posed by specific serovars; support traceback and root cause analysis
- **Academia:** Enable rapid retrieval of serovar-specific information for research

## History

The Wiki was originally built on the [Confluence platform](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/FOODSAFETY/Salmonella+Serovar+Wiki) at Cornell University. This MkDocs-based version provides improved accessibility, version control, and community contribution workflows.

## Serovar Page Structure

Each serovar page includes up to eight sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Background Information** | Scientific name, antigenic formula, serogroup, initial identification, clinical symptoms, prevalence |
| **Genetic Characteristics** | Antimicrobial resistance patterns, virulence factors, phylogenetic information |
| **Animal Reservoir** | Known animal reservoirs and host associations |
| **Geographical Distribution** | Countries and regions where the serovar has been reported |
| **Human/Animal Outbreaks** | Year, location, source, and case count for documented outbreaks |
| **Border Rejections** | Exporting country, enforcing country, source, and product category |
| **Recalls** | Year, location, recalled product, and recall type |
| **Relevant Links** | References and source citations |

## Data Sources

The Salmonella Serovar Wiki consolidates information from publicly available data sources, including peer-reviewed scientific literature, surveillance reports, genomic databases, and regulatory agency publications.
