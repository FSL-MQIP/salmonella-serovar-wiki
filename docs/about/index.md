# About

## Purpose

*Salmonella* is a major foodborne pathogen worldwide, with more than 2,500 serovars identified across the genus. Despite this diversity, no centralized platform previously existed to collectively describe key serovar-level information such as geographical distribution, genomic characteristics, animal reservoirs, and outbreak history.

The **Salmonella Serovar Wiki** was developed to fill this gap — a curated resource that consolidates data from authoritative public health and regulatory sources into a single, searchable platform.

### Who is it for?

=== "Public Health"

    Facilitates **hypothesis generation** during outbreak investigations. Epidemiologists and environmental health professionals can quickly identify historical outbreak patterns, common food vehicles, and geographical hotspots for a given serovar.

=== "Industry"

    Helps food industry professionals understand **contamination risks** posed by specific serovars. Supports internal traceback investigation and root cause analysis by identifying ingredients historically contaminated with specific serovars.

=== "Academia"

    Enables researchers to **rapidly retrieve** serovar-specific information, avoiding redundant literature searches. Highlights understudied serovars where further research is needed.

## Serovar Page Structure

Each serovar page follows a standardized eight-section format:

| Section | What's Included |
|---------|-----------------|
| :material-information-outline: **Background** | Scientific name, antigenic formula, serogroup, first isolation, clinical symptoms, prevalence |
| :material-dna: **Genetic Characteristics** | AMR patterns, virulence factors, phylogenetic classification |
| :material-cow: **Animal Reservoir** | Known host associations and reservoir species |
| :material-earth: **Geographical Distribution** | Countries and regions where the serovar has been reported |
| :material-alert-circle-outline: **Human/Animal Outbreaks** | Year, location, source, case count |
| :material-shield-alert-outline: **Border Rejections** | Exporting/enforcing country, source, product category |
| :material-package-variant-closed: **Recalls** | Year, location, recalled product, type |
| :material-link-variant: **Relevant Links** | Numbered references and citations |

## History

The Wiki was originally built on the Confluence platform at Cornell University. This MkDocs-based version (launched 2026) provides:

- **Full-text search** across all serovars
- **Version control** via Git — every edit is tracked
- **Community contributions** through pull requests
- **Responsive design** for mobile and desktop

## Maintainers

Primary maintenance and curation is handled by members of the [Cornell Food Safety Laboratory](https://foodsafety.cornell.edu/) (Wiedmann Lab).
