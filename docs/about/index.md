# About the Salmonella Serovar Wiki

The Salmonella Serovar Wiki was developed to address the lack of a centralized resource providing serovar-specific information on *Salmonella*. It consolidates data from authoritative public health and regulatory sources into a single, searchable platform.

## Purpose

- **Public Health:** Facilitate hypothesis generation and aid outbreak investigations
- **Industry:** Understand contamination risks posed by specific serovars; support traceback and root cause analysis
- **Academia:** Enable rapid retrieval of serovar-specific information for research

## History

The Wiki was originally built on the Confluence platform at Cornell University. This MkDocs-based version provides improved accessibility, version control, and community contribution workflows.

## Maintainers

Primary maintenance and curation is handled by members of the [Cornell Food Safety Laboratory](https://foodsafety.cornell.edu/).
