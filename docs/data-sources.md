# Data Sources

The Salmonella Serovar Wiki consolidates information from publicly available data sources, including peer-reviewed scientific literature, surveillance reports, genomic databases, and regulatory agency publications.

!!! note "Source Selection"
    Sources are primarily U.S.- and Europe-based. We are actively working to expand coverage with global contributors. See [Contributing](contributing.md) if you can help.

## Update Criteria

New outbreaks, recalls, or border rejections are added when they meet at least one of the following:

1. **Substantial public health concern** — e.g., a human outbreak with >100 cases
2. **Novel commodity** — associated with a food vehicle not yet documented in the Wiki
3. **Final investigation update** — provides closure on a previously ongoing investigation
