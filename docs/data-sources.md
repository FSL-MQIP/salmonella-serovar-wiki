# Data Sources

The Salmonella Serovar Wiki consolidates information from publicly available data sources, including peer-reviewed scientific literature, surveillance reports, genomic databases, and regulatory agency publications.

!!! note "Source Selection"
    Sources are primarily U.S.- and Europe-based. We are actively working to expand coverage with global contributors. See [Contributing](contributing.md) if you can help.

| [Reports of Selected *Salmonella* Outbreak Investigations](https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/index.html) | These reports summarize selected outbreak investigations linked to food, by year. |
| [BEAM Dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/BEAM-dashboard.html) | Tracks AMR information for a given serovar, including the percentage of outbreak-associated isolates with clinically important AMR. |
| [FoodNet Fast](https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/) | Tracks infections caused by foodborne pathogens like *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter*, *E. coli*, and others in the U.S. |

### USDA FSIS

| Division | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Quarterly Sampling Reports on *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter*](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/science-data/data-sets-visualizations) | These reports provide the percentage of positive samples and serotype sampling data for *Salmonella* and *Campylobacter* for FSIS-inspected raw products. |
| [Outbreak Investigation Annual Reports](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/recalls-public-health-alerts) | These reports provide a summary of outbreaks investigated each fiscal year, detailing the number of outbreaks, pathogens involved, associated products, illnesses, and the number of outbreaks leading to product recalls. |
| [NARMS Multi-Year Report 2014–2019](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/national-antimicrobial-resistance-monitoring-system/narms-now-integrated-data) | This report analyzed trends in *Salmonella* serotypes and AMR in select food animal species and products sampled through NARMS from 2014 to 2019. |

| Division | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Public Health Advisories from Investigations of Foodborne Illness Outbreaks](https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigations-foodborne-illness-outbreaks) | These advisories are issued during outbreak investigations when specific, actionable steps are identified for consumers to protect themselves. |
| [NARMS Now](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/national-antimicrobial-resistance-monitoring-system/narms-now-integrated-data) | This interactive FDA tool provides AMR data for bacteria isolated from humans, including *Salmonella*. |

### ECDC

| Division | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases](https://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/public/index.aspx) | This interactive tool allows users to explore data on infectious diseases including salmonellosis, allowing users to query and manipulate the information based on user-defined criteria and generate customized tables and maps. |
| [Salmonellosis — Annual Epidemiological Report](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/salmonellosis/surveillance-and-disease-data) | This report focuses exclusively on salmonellosis and is based on data from The European Surveillance System. |

## Update Criteria

New outbreaks, recalls, or border rejections are added when they meet at least one of the following:

1. **Substantial public health concern** — e.g., a human outbreak with >100 cases
2. **Novel commodity** — associated with a food vehicle not yet documented in the Wiki
3. **Final investigation update** — provides closure on a previously ongoing investigation
